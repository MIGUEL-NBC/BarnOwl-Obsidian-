{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Studio Maintenance - Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Walls/General Info.docx","text":"Multiplay engines are specific to large format playout such as video walls. They are not located centrally with the main engines, but are generally near their location, 1A, 3A, 6A, etc. These engines generally have video inputs on micro-bnc connectors, and outputs on displayport/hdmi, which go into a set of AJA SDI converters. If the engine is not responding to an operator changing graphics, or a clip is stuttering, troubleshoot the engine. Multiplays are unique in that the engine plays the output in full screen on the desktop. The engine console runs in the background. Anything on the desktop such as the Windows Task Bar or error windows will appear on the output. *Keep in mind the preview output that the control/graphics room sees is POST Aja converters. If the image is cut off, incorrectly sized, or offset, first verify the engine has the correct resolution on the machine itself: If the resolution is incorrect, the machine may not be detecting an output cable, or the nvidia software just needs to be reconfigured. This tells the three outputs to act as one large high resolution monitor. You can find sync information in System Topology. To change sync settings, use the synchronize displays menu. If the resolution is correct, it may be the Aja converters. Start by power cycling them. We have also seen PSUs for them go bad.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
