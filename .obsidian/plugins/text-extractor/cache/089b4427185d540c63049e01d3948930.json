When the slider control is displayed, touch and swipe the up arrow at the bottom of the slider to close the control. The Error Log is also divided into the following four columns: Event: Shows the current state of the log entries: Red (rising edge) items are detected errors. Green (falling edge) items are errors that have cleared. Red / Green (rising and falling edge) items indicate a momentary error that requires no action. White items are informational and identify a change in instrument state. Source: Shows the inputs on which the errors have occurred. Date: Shows the date and time, according to the internal clock, that the error occurred in the form YYYY-MM-DD. Time: Shows the time, according to the internal clock, that the error occurred in the form HH:MM:SS. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 79 Application information Timing application The Timing application allows you to compare an input reference for one or two IP video signals, dependent on ST2022-6 or ST2022-7. When an input has ST2022–7 enabled, circles for Path 1 (green) and Path 2 (blue) will appear, otherwise only a single path will display. When the input signal is fully aligned with PTP, both circles will be in the center of the display indicated by the “+” symbol. NOTE. PTP must be locked to use the Timing application. Figure 60: Timing application display Elements of the Timing application display Path 1 and Path 2: Displays the video format. NOTE. You can switch between Path 1, Path 2, or both Path 1-2 using the Path button at the top right of the application display. Master ID: Displays the reference Source and Domain. PTP Time: Time of day derived from the PTP signals. Protocol : Displays the input protocol. Ref Lock:A indicates the input is locked to PTP. A indicates the input is not locked to PTP. Reference Indicator: A cross-hair indictor centered in the display represents the reference signal. 80 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Circle:The circle represents the timing of the input signal. A signal that is early will be above or to the left of the cross hair. A signal that is late will be below or to the right. Offsets: The difference in timing between the input and reference. A positive number, or \"delayed\" value, means the input occurs after the reference. A negative number, or \"advanced\" value, means the input occurs before the reference. Time: The total difference in frame timing between the input and reference Pixels: The timing difference between the reference and input signal, expressed as in pixels, instead of time units, after the vertical offset has been removed. This has a range of +-1/2 a line for the input format. Vertical Offset: The timing difference between the reference and input signal, expressed as the number of lines of delay for the input video format. This has a range of +-1/2 ﬁeld for progressive signals and +-1/2 frame for interlace signals. Horizontal Offset: The timing difference between the reference and input signal, expressed as the line time which remains from the total delay after the vertical offset has been removed. This has a range of +-1/2 a line for the input format. Timing offsets for IP signals Since ST2022-6 streams are complete SDI signals encapsulated in IP, the timing measurement treats these IP signals as if they were SDI. So the timing system detects the start of the IP frame, then extrapolates to the 0h point of the encapsulated SDI. Then using PTP as the reference, the ideal alignment point for that frame rate is calculated based on the PTP epoch. Finally the offset between the ST 2022-6 signal and the ideal alignment is displayed. The display shows both absolute time and the time parsed into lines or horizontal delay as time and pixels. Use cases for measuring timing One use case for the Timing application is to measure the delay in a gateway and network. If a properly timed SDI signal is applied to a gateway, then the timing measurement on the resulting IP ﬂow will display the combined latency in the gateway and the network. Another use case is to measure multiple signals and compare the relative timing. This was commonly done in SDI and Composite environments to enable timing adjustment of the various black signals in order to align the inputs to the production switcher. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 81 Application information IP Status application The IP Status application provides an overview of the monitored IP stream and shows the status of each program in the stream. Once the input signals have been subscribed to using the input settings menu, the trafﬁc on the SFP ports can be viewed using the IP Status application. Depending on the network switch deployed, the trafﬁc may not appear in the IP Status application immediately. NOTE. IP Status is available only with Option MP-IP-STD installed. To view Port 1 and Port 2 1. Launch the IP Status application in one of the tiles (press/hold in the tile and select from the list of applications). 2. Open the IP Status settings menu by press/hold in the tile and select the icon. 3. In the IP Status settings menu select “Both” to monitor both Port 1 and Port 2. Figure 61: IP Status port settings With both ports selected there will be two trafﬁcbarsshowing theamountof trafﬁc on each port, as well as a trafﬁc table that now indicates a “Port” column. The columns are sortable. The selected input is now highlighted in the ID column. When the row is highlighted in yellow it indicates a signal that was present and is now gone. Hit the reset button at the right side of the banner (at top) to clear the signals that are no longer there. 82 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Figure 62: IP Status application display Elements of the IP Status application display Port 1 and Port 2: Status of Port 1 and Port 2. Total: Shows the total bit rate of the video in the IP stream. IP stream bandwidth bar: The blue bar outline at the top of the display represents the total bandwidth of the 10GbE pipe (10.3125 Gb/s). The blue bars inside the outline show the relative bandwidth size of items in the IP stream compared to the total available bandwidth of the stream. Numbers inside the blue bars correspond to the ID numbers listed in the display. Run Time. The instrument maintains a running IP Status Session. The Run Time readout displays the amount of time that has elapsed during the current IP Status Session. The time is displayed as \"DD, HH:MM:SS\", where DD is the number of days, HH is the number of hours, MM is the number of minutes, and SS is the number of seconds. Clear icon.Use the icon to reset the status session. After a reset, items will appear in the list in the order they are detected. Yellow highlighting: When an item in the list is highlighted in yellow, as shown above for ID number 18, that indicates the item was previously detected in the stream but is no longer present. The yellow highlighting can also indicate messages, which occur only for a few seconds. Use the icon to reset the display to view only the items currently in the stream. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 83 Application information The IP Status application is also divided into the following ﬁve columns: ID: Shows the ID number of each item in the IP stream. The ID numbers correspond to the numbers in the blue bar at the top of the display. Port: Shows the Port number being monitored. Protocol: Shows the protocol being used by each item in the IP stream. Bitrate: Shows the bitrate of each item in the IP stream. Source IP: Shows the source IP address and port number of the monitored stream in the form <source IP address>:<port number>. Dest IP: Shows the destination IP address and port number of the monitored stream in the form <destination IP address>:<port number>. 84 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information IP Session application The IP Session application uses three tabs to display status of various IP stream parameters. Touch any of the three tab titles to view the associated information: Layer 1/2, Video, or PTP. NOTE. Option MP-IP-MEAS must be installed to use the IP Session application. The display will show only Path 1 unless you enable ST2022-7 Seamless Switching, (See page 36, How to conﬁgure signal inputs.) There is a difference between “Port” and “Path”. The Port is the physical SPF port that is used to input the 10 GbE signal. Path 1 and Path 2 are the signal paths to be used for seamless switching. This differentiation is being made since it is possible for both Path 1 and Path 2 to use a single Port. Elements of the top-level IP Session application display The elements at the top of the IP Session application are shared between the three tabs: Display tabs: Click on one of the three tabs to view the associated display. Each of the tabs has a status indicator to provide a quick view of the status of the parameters contained in each tab. Layer 1/2. Use this tab to view the status of various signal parameters in the physical and link layers. Video. Use this tab to view the status of the video in the stream. PTP. Use this tab to view PTP parameters. Run Time. The instrument maintains a running monitoring session for the IP Session application. The Run Time readout displays the amount of time that has elapsed during the current monitoring session. The time is displayed as \"DD, HH:MM:SS\", where DD is the number of days, HH is the number of hours, MM is the number of minutes, and SS is the number of seconds. Clear icon.Use the icon to clear or reset the monitoring session. Running / Stopped icons. When the monitoring session is running (collecting error data), use the icon to stop the session. When the session is stopped (no error data collection and no display updates), use the icon to restart the session. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 85 Application information LAYER 1/2 tab display Usethistab to view the status of the following signal parameters: Figure 63: IP Session application – Layer 1/2 tab display Elements of the Layer 1/2 tab display.

PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 91 Application information PTP tab display Use this tab to view the status of the PTP elements in the stream. PTP is currently only supported on 10 GbE SFP Port 1, for instructions on locking to PTP, (See page 43, How to conﬁgure PTP reference settings.) Figure 65: IP Session application – PTP tab display Elements of the PTP tab display. Lock Status: Indicates whether the instrument PTP slave is locked to the master PTP signal for the selected domain. The following values may appear: No master present: Indicates that the master PTP clock has not been detected on the selected domain. Locked: Indicates that the master PTP clock is detected and there is less than 1000 ns of phase lag between the master clock and the instrument. Unlocked: Indicates that the master PTP clock is detected and there is greater than 1000 ns of phase lag between the master clock and the instrument. PTP time: Shows the time derived from the PTP Master as UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Master/Slave Phase Lag: Shows the detected offset between the master and slave clocks. Master ID: Shows the MAC Address of PTP Master with the bytes \"ff:fe\" inserted in the middle. This ID is also used in the BMCA as a tiebreaker when all of the parameters match down through priority 2. Steps Removed: Shows the number of communication paths traversed between the local clock and the Grandmaster clock. 92 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Domain:Shows the domain being used. Domains allow multiple PTP services to coexist simultaneously on one physical Ethernet connection. Proﬁle:Shows the proﬁle being used: General, AES67, or ST2059. This is the user-selected proﬁle set on the Settings > Reference conﬁguration menu page and is not detected on the input. Delay Message Interval: For Multicast communication mode, the only delay message interval allowed is \"Follow Master\". In this mode, the slave will set the delay request rate according to the information sent by the master in the delay response message. NOTE. The PRISM monitor currently supports Multicast communication mode and SMPTE mixed mode without negotiation. In later ﬁrmware releases, other communication modes will be supported. Grandmaster BCMA Values: Lists the following values for the Grandmaster BCMA (Best Master Clock Algorithm) in order of precedence: Priority 1: This parameter deﬁnes which clocks are allowed to be consideredasmasters. Tobeconsideredasamaster,the valueshouldbe set to 128 or less. Priority 1 is the ﬁrst criteria in the BMCA, so if Priority 1 is set to a lower value than other devices on the system, then it will be chosen even if the clock quality is poor. Typically, all the masters in a domain should have the same value for the Priority 1 parameter. Clock Class: This value characterizes the TAI (International Atomic Time) traceability. The clock class value varies to indicate the type of reference in use by the Grandmaster clock. For example, when locked to GPS the PTP grandmaster will report a class 6. However, if in holdover mode after locking to GPS, then it will report a class of 7. Clock Accuracy: This value characterizes the clock accuracy for the purpose of determining the best master clock. Clock Variance: This value is reported by the PTP master to indicate the variance of the clock over a one second interval. A lower number indicates a more stable clock and will be preferred by the BMCA. Priority 2: This parameter is used to break the tie between masters that have the same clock quality. Several values may be used to deﬁne a hierarchy of devices. Most proﬁles use 128 as a default, so a value of 127 or lower would indicate a preferred master. Clock Source: The clock source ﬁeld is not used by the BMCA. The ﬁeld is set to indicate the type of reference in use by the Grandmaster clock. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 93 Application information Communication Mode: There are three basic message modes for PTP: Multicast, Unicast, and mixed Multicast and Unicast. For full Multicast or Unicast modes, all of the PTP messages are sent in the selected mode type. NOTE. The PRISM monitor currently supports Multicast communication mode and SMPTE mixed mode without negotiation. In later ﬁrmware releases, other communication modes will be supported. For some proﬁles, such as some telecom proﬁles and the SMPTE ST2059 proﬁle, a mixture of Multicast and Unicast are allowed. On the SMPTE proﬁle unique mixed mode, the Announce and Sync messages are sent as multicast. However, the Delay request and Delay Response messages are sent as Unicast. Some points to understand about communication modes: Whatever mode is chosen, the master and slave must match or be compatible Multicast and Mixed mode may need IGMP joins and leaves Full Unicast must have the master address in all slave AMTs Unicast without negotiation does not allow master to regulate load Two masters can be used on different domains to serve slaves on different communication modes Delay Mechanism: Shows the delay mechanism mode being used: NOTE. The PRISM monitor currently supports only the End-to-End delay mechanism. End-to-End: In this mode, the sync, follow up, delay request and delay response messages go through the network all the way between the master and slave. End-to-End mode is useful in PTP networks where some or all devices are not PTP aware. Peer-to-Peer: In this mode, the Pdelay request and Pdelay response messages are local to each link in the network. Each device determines the local link and device delays. The sync message from the master then collects the corrections as it propagates from the master to slave. Peer-to-Peer mode is useful in PTP networks where the routing conﬁguration changes. For Peer-to-Peer mode to work well, all of the devices need to be PTP aware. 94 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Message rates: Announce: Displays the rate of the Announce messages received from the master. Typical values are 1 to 4 messages a second but a wide range is allowedbysomeproﬁles. If the value is lower than expected then it may indicate a problem in the network or the master. Sync: Displays the rate of the Sync messages received from the master. Typical values are 1 to 16 messages a second, but some proﬁles allow much higher rates. If the value is lower than expected then it may indicate a problem in the network or the master. Delay Request: Displays the rate of the Delay Request messages sent by the slave. In multi-cast mode, the Delay Request rate is required to be set in response to a ﬁeld in the Delay Response message from the master. Typically the master will set this ﬁeld such that the Delay Request message rate is equal to the Sync message rate. NOTE. For SMPTE mixed mode, PRISM sets the delay Request rate equal to the Sync message rate received from the master. Delay Response: Displays the rate of the Delay Response messages received from the master. Each Delay Request should have a matching Delay Response, so if the value is lower than expected then it may indicate a problem in the network or the master PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 95 Application information IP Graphs application Use the IP Graphs application to view various graphs that show aspects of the IP stream. As you scroll through the various graphs, the top of the selected graph will jump to the top of the display area to aid in viewing the complete graph. The displayed graph will be included in a saved preset. The IP Graphs application has been enhanced to include Path 1 and Path 2, if ST2022-7 monitoring is conﬁgured. The graph data can be switched between viewing only Path 1, Path 2, or both by using the Path button in the upper right of the screen. NOTE. Option MP-IP-MEAS must be installed to use the IP Graphs application. Elements of the top-level IP Graphs application display The elements at the top of the IP Graphs application are shared between all graphs: NOTE. Only Path 1 will display unless you enable ST2022-7 Seamless Switching, (See page 36, How to conﬁgure signal inputs.) Port 1 and Port 2: Shows the physical port(s) on the instrument. Src/Dest: Lists the source and destination addresses of the IP stream. Protocol: Lists the protocol being used by the monitored stream. Res: Lists the resolution of the graph display. Path button: Use the Path button to switch between Path 1, Path 2, or both Path 1 and Path 2. 96 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Figure 66: IP Graphs application display Total Bit Rate graph The Total Bit Rate graph shows the total bit rate currently on the 10 GbE input. The maximum available bandwidth is 10.3 Gb/s. The following readouts appear: Max: Shows maximum bandwidth used during the time window. Mean: Shows the mean bandwidth used during the time window. Min: Shows the minimum bandwidth used during the time window. Free Min/Max: Shows the minimum and maximum available bandwidth that is not being consumed. Session Bit Rate graph The Session Bit Rate graph shows the data rate of the currently selected input stream. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 97 Application information Figure 67: IP Graphs application – PIT and RTP Sequence Error graphs PIT graph The PIT (Packet Interval Time) graph shows the difference in arrival time between sequential packets of the active stream. This is one indication of the packet jitter and dropped packet rate. The colored bars represent the range from minimum to maximum for all of the packets within that time interval. RTP Sequence Error graph The RTP Sequence Error: Shows the RTP sequence information and reports if any packet is received out of order. Reconstructed path errors: In addition to counting Path 1 and Path 2 RTP sequence errors, the number of packets that could not be corrected is shown. An output packet could be uncorrected if it is dropped on both paths or there is too much skew between the paths resulting in a buffer overﬂow. The number of reconstructed path errors also applies to situations when ST2022-7 is turned off. Packets could pass uncorrected if they are dropped or if reordering results in an input buffer overﬂow. (See Figure 67.) 98 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Figure 68: IP Graphs application – Video CRC Error and TS-DF graphs Video CRC Error graph The Video CRC Error graph shows any present CRC errors within the currently decoded signal and can be compared to other time graphs such as RTP Sequence Errors. TS-DF graph The TS-DF graph shows the Time Stamped Delay Factor, as deﬁned in EBU Tech 3337, which is a method for measuring network jitter in RTP streams. (See Figure 68.) PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 99 Application information Path1–Path2 Differential graph Path Differential represents the time difference between the Path 1 and Path 2 streams in a ST2022-7 system. As the path differential gets larger, it becomes more difﬁcult for equipment receiving the data to properly process both paths, depending on the size of the input buffer in the equipment. The ST2022-7 speciﬁcation deﬁnes Path Differential as an absolute value, but the Path1-Path2 Differential graph shows the signed value of Path 1 minus Path 2. A positive value means that Path 2 is lagging Path 1.

Just like in IP Graphs, the “Path” button in the upper right corner of the tile can be used to view only Path 1 (green), only Path 2 (blue), or both Path 1 and Path 2 data (cyan where Path 1 and 2 are overlapped). Figure 71: PIT Histogram application display Elements of the PIT Histogram display Source/Dest: Lists the source and destination addresses of the IP stream. Protocol: Lists the protocol being used by the monitored stream. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 101 Application information PTP graphs application Use the PTP Graphs application to monitor the message timing between Master and Slave in a PTP network. For more information on PTP operations and settings, (See page 43, How to conﬁgure PTP reference settings.) and (See page 105, PTP introduction.) NOTE. Option MP-IP-MEAS must be installed to use the PTP Graphs application. Setting the PTP interval 1. Open the PTP Graphs settings menu by press/hold in the tile and select the icon. 2. Select the PTP Trend Interval time setting. The PTP Trend Interval setting is the extent of the horizontal axis on the graph. 3. Close the settings box. Elements of the PTP Graph The PTP graphs are useful in observing the effects of trafﬁc on the PTP messages and the operation of transparent and boundary clocks. Non-PTP aware switches may have signiﬁcant PTP delay variations, while transparent and boundary clocks will have much less variation and total delay. Figure 72: PTP Master-Slave Delay and Variation graphs 102 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Application information Top of the display: PTP Lock: Shows the status of the PTP lock. Master ID: Displays the reference Source and Domain. PTP Time:Time of day derived from the PTP signals. Proﬁle:Shows the proﬁle which has been selected in the reference settings menu. This is not detected from the incoming PTP messages. Resolution: The time increment for each bar on the display. Longer graph settings collect data into larger bins to be displayed. This range and resulting resolution are selected in the setting menu for PTP graphs. Trace Types: There are four displays available. For each one, the Max, min and average are show on the left, while the traces vs time is shown on he right. The traces indicate the Max, and Min envelop, as well as the average for each time bin. The time scale can be adjusted in the settings menu – touch and hold the menu bar to access this menu. The data is logged for 7 days so one can go back and look at long term trends.

After the slave is locked and the timing is stable, then the perturbation on this graph are largely due to network variations.

As the system locks the Master to Slave and Slave to master delays should converge on the same value. This value represents the average network delay between the master and slave for the trafﬁc in both direction. If the network delay is too unstable, then the PTP may never be able to lock. This will appear as large variations on this trace. Master Slave Variation graph: The master to slave variation, is derived from the same data as the master to slave delay. The absolute value of the changes in delay are ﬁltered according to RFC1889 and displayed. This display then shows a measure of the variation of the network delay. A low value will indicate that a PTP slave will have an easy time locking, a large value will indicate it may be challenging for a PTP slave to get a good lock.

Not all of the functionality described is currently available in the PRISM monitor. PTP introduction PTP master selection In a PTP network, all the masters on the network are evaluated by the Best Master Clock Algorithm(BMCA). TheBMCArunsonall devices, andchoosesamaster based on several parameters. Some of the parameters relate to clock quality; conversely the Priority 1 and Priority 2 parameters are set by the user to inﬂuence the choice of a master: NOTE. The PRISM monitor has no role in setting the priority parameters or in providing information to the BMCA. Priority 1. This parameter deﬁnes which clocks are allowed to be considered as masters. To be considered as a master, the value should be set to 128 or less. Priority 1 is the ﬁrst criteria in the BMCA, so if Priority 1 is set to a lower value than other devices on the system, then it will be chosen even if the clock quality is poor. Typically, all the masters in a domain should have the same value for the Priority 1 parameter. Priority 2. This parameter is used to break the tie between masters that have the same clock quality. Several values may be used to deﬁne a hierarchy of devices. Most proﬁles use 128 as a default, so a value of 127 or lower would indicate a preferred master. The ﬁnal tie-breaker in the BMCA is the clock ID. This is usually the MAC address so it provides a unique value by which the BMCA can choose. Network topology In a typical IEEE1588 PTP network, many devices may be either masters or slaves. If the current master stops working, all the devices that are capably of being a master broadcast their clock quality and a new master is selected. For video networks it may make sense to depart from the telecom-style PTP topology and dedicate devices to be only masters or slaves. This is the approach supported by the PRISM monitor, which allows for a more traditional primary and backup master structure controlling a range of slave devices. The BMCA is still used to select the active master and the network still takes the place of the ECO in the legacy Black-burst/Tri-level network. The PRISM monitor is a slave-only device. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 105 PTP operational overview The ﬁve basic PTP timing messages The ﬁve basic timing messages in a PTP system are described below. Other messages are present in some instances. For example, grant requests and responses appear in unicast systems, and Type Length Value (TLV) management messages appear in SMPTE ST2059 proﬁle systems. Announce message The Announce message is sent by the master to advertise its capability. This message contains the clock quality and priority settings needed for the BMCA to evaluate which device is the best master. Sync message The Sync message is sent by the master and is used to measure the propagation delay from the master to slave. The sync message may contain the timestamp indicating when it was sent, or that time may be in the Follow-up message. The receiver must timestamp the sync message upon receipt. These two timestamps are usually called “t1” and “t2” and provide the ﬁrst delay measurement. Follow-up message The Follow-up message is sent only in cases where the PTP network hardware is not capable of inserting the timestamp or corrections into the Sync message. (See page 108, One-step and two-step operation.) Delay request message The Delay request is sent by the slave. The time at which it is sent is noted by the slave, but is not included in the message. This time is usually called “t3.” When the delay request is received by the master, the master timestamps the receive time. This timestamp is usually called “t4.” Delay response message The delay response is sent from the master to the slave. The response contains the t4 time stamp from when the master received the delay request. Once the slave receives the delay response, it has the second pair of timestamps needed to calculate the second delay measurement of the slave to master delay. 106 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual PTP operational overview Message timing The following ﬁgure show the relationships between the ﬁve PTP timing messages. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 107 PTP operational overview Proﬁles and domains Multiple domains and proﬁles can coexist on the same network. Proﬁles TheIEEE1588standarddeﬁnes multiple parameters, such as the rates for Sync and Announce messages, and optional functions such as grandmaster clusters. Speciﬁc industries wanting to use PTP are encouraged to deﬁne their own “proﬁle,” which allows the PTP standard to be tuned for speciﬁc applications. The proﬁle deﬁnes the default and range of each parameter, and deﬁnes with options are required, allowed or prohibited. In the Prism monitor, the user should select the PTP proﬁle (General, ST2059, or AES67). The user can then modify the proﬁle parameters and save as part of an instrument preset. The allowed range of the parameters is restricted to that which is allowed for the selected proﬁle type. Domains TheIEEE1588standarddeﬁnes “domains,” which allow multiple PTP services to coexist simultaneously on one physical Ethernet connection. For example, on a given network one master and several slaves can be using domain 0 while a second master and other slaves are using domain 1. These two PTP services are independent. One use for this is to have masters on different domains provide PTP on different proﬁles. For example, domain 0 might be an AES67 proﬁle, domain 1 could be a master using the AVB (802.1AS) proﬁle, and domain 127 could be a master on the SMPTE ST2059 proﬁle. One-step and two-step operation Some PTP messages have a time stamp associated with them. This time stamp indicates the time of the local clock when the message was sent or received. In some cases, the hardware is capable of embedding the time stamp in the message as it is sent. This is known as “one-step” mode since the message and its associated time are sent together. In other cases, the hardware is not capable of inserting the time into the message, so instead it is sent in a second follow-up message. This is called “two-step” mode since there are two messages. It is interesting to note that in End-to-Endmode, only theSyncmessageiseffected by the one-step and two-step setting since it is the only message that needs the transmit time stamp inserted. In a similar fashion, Peer-to-Peer mode has some messages that may require follow-up support. The IEEE1588 standard speciﬁes that all slaves are required to operate with either one-step or two-step message types. Onetypeofdevicewhich oftenrequires two-step operation is a Transparent Clock, since it has to calculate the residence time of a message and insert that time into the message or the follow up message. 108 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual PTP operational overview Multicast, Unicast, and Mixed Communication modes There are three basic message modes for PTP: Multicast, Unicast, and mixed Multicast and Unicast. For full Multicast or Unicast modes, all of the PTP messages are sent in the selected mode type. For some proﬁles, such as some telecom proﬁles and the SMPTE ST2059 proﬁle, a mixture of Multicast and Unicast are allowed. On the SMPTE proﬁle unique mixed mode, the Announce and Sync messages are sent as multicast. However, the Delay Request and Delay Response messages are sent as Unicast. Some points to understand about communication modes: Whatever mode is chosen, the master and slave must match or be compatible Multicast and Mixed mode may need IGMP joins and leaves Full Unicast must have the master address in all slave AMTs Unicast without negotiation does not allow master to regulate load Two masters can be used on different domains to serve slaves on different communication modes All of the master and slave devices on a given domain must use compatible communication modes. For most proﬁles, this means the master and slave communication modes need to match exactly. On the SMPTE proﬁle, the Multicast and Mixed modes are compatible, so a master in any of these modes should work with a slave in any of those modes. Multicast system messages Multicast messages are broadcast and so they can be received without knowing the address of the sender. This allows a slave to hook up to the network, receive the announce messages and discover the identity of the master. Multicast in some networks requires the devices to use IGMP to join and leave the multicast group. In Multicast PTP systems, the master sets the rate of the announce and sync messages. The master also sends the maximum allowed delay request rate in the delay response message. Ideally, the slave will use that value to set the delay request rate although some slave set this rate independently. The delay request rate is typically the same as the sync rate, but may be higher or lower. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 109 PTP operational overview Unicast system messages Unicast messages require the address of the master be entered into the Acceptable Master Table (AMT) in each slave. If there are multiple masters, the IP address for each master must be entered in the AMTs of all the slaves. In Unicast PTP systems, the slave must have the address of the master in its acceptable master table because the slave initiates the communication with the master. The slave sends several grant requests to the master requesting speciﬁc rates for each message type. If the master accepts the grant requests, it will send grant acknowledges. If the master denies the grant, the slave may send a new grant request at alower rate. Thisprocess maycontinue for several iterations until the master and slave agree on a rate. The master and slave will then start exchanging the PTP messages. If the master cannot support any of the rates requested by the slave, then the slave will not be able to lock to the master. Mixed mode system messages In Mixed Mode systems, some messages are Multicast and some are Unicast. For the SMPTE ST2059 proﬁle, the Announce and Sync messages are sent as Multicast. This allows devices to discover the active master. The Delay Request messages are conﬁgured as Unicast, in some case with negotiation, and in other cases without negotiation. SMPTE proﬁle system messages For SMPTE proﬁle systems, a given domain must use one type of message for all Announce, Sync and Follow up messages. Therefore, all masters and slaves on that domain must be conﬁgured for either Multicast or they all must be conﬁgured for Unicast. For SMPTE mixed mode, the Announce, Sync, and Follow up messages are conﬁgured as Multicast, whereas the delay requests can be Multicast, Unicast, or Unicast without negotiation. To use this combination with a Tektronix SPG8000A master clock generator, set the master and slave to any of the modes: Multicast, Mixed, or Mixed without negotiation. The masters will support all of the slave modes simultaneously. 110 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual PTP operational overview BMCA operation The Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) is used to choose the active master on the domain. This is partially explained in the introduction to this document. The BMCA operation varies somewhat as function of communication mode. Multicast mode In Multicast mode, the active master sends announce messages which all other masters and slaves can receive. So all devices can evaluate the BMCA and decide on the best master. If any device detects that its BMCA rating is better than the current master, it will send an announce and take over as the active master. Unicast mode In Unicast mode, slaves only get Announce messages if they establish a grant from the master. Therefore, each slave must set up a grant with every device in its AMT. Since the masters do not set up grants from other masters, they do not have the information to evaluate the BMCA and know if they are the active master. It is up to the slaves to evaluate the BMCA based on the announce message they get from each master in their AMT. Each slave then decides which master is the best and then set up grants for the other message types. If slaves on a given network have a different list of masters in their AMT, then they may choose a different master. Mixed mode In a SMPTE ST2059 mixed environment, the announce message is Multicast. Therefore, the BMCA can follow the Multicast conventions. Compensating for causes of asymmetric delay Several factors can cause the PTP message delay to be different for the messages sent from the master to slave as opposed to the messages the other direction from the slave to master. Unless corrected, this propagation delay asymmetry will cause an offset in the clock phase equal to ½ the difference in the two path delays. There are 4 main causes of asymmetric delay: Rate mismatch in the ports on a switch, Trafﬁc mismatch on the two paths, message type mismatch, and cable delay variation. The paragraphs below contain hints on how to design the system to minimize the delay asymmetry. Alternatively, some slaves provide a way to manually enter a correction value to cancel the delay error. Rate mismatch Rate mismatch in a switch causes a delay asymmetry due to the fact that the switch does a “store and forward” on messages. This means the entire message must be stored in the buffer before it starts to be “forwarded” or sent out. For example, for a 100 Mb input and 1 Gb output, the switch must wait for the entire message to clock in at the slow rate before it can start outputting the message at the high rate. Conversely for a 1 Gb/s input and 100 Mb/s output, the entire packet is quickly read in at the faster rate, so then the output can start sooner, albeit at a lower rate. PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 111 PTP operational overview While the total time is the same for both directions, the delay on the fast-in, slow-out direction is shorter on the packets which contain the PTP timestamps. This effect is signiﬁcant on a 100 Mb/1 Gb rate mismatch, but much less signiﬁcant on a 1 G/10 G switch since the message time at 1 Gb/s is quite short. If the switch supports Transparent Clock (TC) mode, then this rate mismatch delay effect is corrected by the TC delay correction. Trafﬁcmismatch Another cause of asymmetric delay is trafﬁc mismatch on the two paths. If there is a high percentage of trafﬁc utilization on the master to slave path, then most of the PTP messages may be delayed signiﬁcantly. If the trafﬁc on the other direction is signiﬁcantly different, then the messages on the path may not suffer the same delay. This effect can be quite large depending on the trafﬁc, the quality of the switch, and the number of switches in the network. To reduce this effect, a user should avoid large loading on the PTP network, use high-quality switches that avoid this delay variance, or use PTP Transparent mode switches which will insert residence time information to allow the slave to correct for this delay. Setting the Diff Serve QoS on the switch and conﬁguring the PTP messages with an appropriate DSCP can also mitigate the effects of trafﬁcdelay. Message type mismatch Another cause of delay asymmetry is message type mismatch. For example, if the sync message is Multicast and the delay request is Unicast, then some switches may process the messages differently and cause a differential delay. Since the SMPTE proﬁle allows a mixed mode operation, switches should be evaluated to ensure they do not have this effect. If transparent mode switches are used, then this effect should be corrected by the slave. Cable delay variation The actual propagation delay through Cat 5 cable can be signiﬁcantly different in one direction versus the other direction. This can be due to the twist rate on the pairs, routing inside the sheath, material differences, etc. The PTP system is incapable of removing this effect, so the best way to prevent this is to use high-quality cable with a minimum variation in the physical propagation delay. 112 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual Index Symbols and Numbers 1PPS output, 21 A API commands, 35 Applications, 66 Audio, 70 Event Log, 78 how to select, 28 IP Graphs, 96 IP Session, 85 IP Status, 82 list, 66 Picture, 69 PIT Histogram, 101 PTP graphs, 102 Timing, 80 Video Session, 72 Waveform, 68 Audio In-bar warnings, 70 Level meters, 70 Audio application, 70 Above bar warnings, 71 In-bar warnings, 71 C Capture, 64 screenshot, 64 stream, 64 Conﬁgure ASPEN, 42 IP stream input, 40 PTP reference settings, 43 signal inputs, 36 D Diagnostics report, 26 Display elements, 25 Display information, 66 Displays how to select, 28 Documentation purposes of, xi E Event Log application, 78 F Factory preset recall, 51 Firmware upgrade, 55 Front panel MPI, 27 MPX controls, 29 H How to conﬁgure an IP stream input, 40 conﬁgure ASPEN, 42 conﬁgure PTP reference settings, 43 conﬁgure signal inputs, 36 conﬁgure the instrument, 36 Connect to a network, 20 connect to a PC, 19 enable ST2022-7 seamless switching, 40 ﬁnd more information, xi rename a signal input, 39 upgrade software, 58 I Information where to ﬁnd more, xi Internal time and date how to set, 53 IP Graphs application, 96 Path1 - Path2 Differential graph, 100 PIT graph, 98 RTP Sequence Error graph, 98 Session Bit Rate graph, 97 Total Bit Rate graph, 97 TS-DF graph, 99 Video CRC Error graph, 99 IP Session application, 85 LAYER 1/2 tab display, 86 PTP tab display, 92 VIDEO tab display, 88 IP settings, 20 IP Status application, 82 Port settings, 82 K Keyboard and mouse operation, 31 M MPI install, 6 power, 11 rear panel connectors, 21 SFP+ module installation, 17 touchscreen operation, 27 MPX front panel controls, 29 front panel operation, 30 power, 15 rear panel connectors, 23 SFP+ module installation, 18 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual 113 Index N Network Connect to, 20 IP settings, 20 P PC Connect to, 19 Picture application, 69 PIT Histogram application, 101 Presets factory, 51 recalling, 50 renaming, 46 saving, 46 PTP graphs application, 102 setting PTP interval, 102 PTP overview, 105 R Rear panel connectors MPI, 21 MPX, 23 Recalling presets, 50 Remote control API commands, 35 VNC operation, 32 Renaming presets, 46 S Saving presets, 46 Seamless switching, enabling, 40 Selecting an application, 28 Status indicators, 67 Stream Capture, 64 Supplied hardware, 5 T Time and date how to set, 53 Timing application, 80 offsets, 81 U Upgrade software, 58 Upgrading ﬁrmware, 55 V Video Session application, 72 BIT LEVEL display, 75 CRC STATUS display, 76 SDI FORMAT display, 73 VPID 352 display, 74 Volume, 63 W Warnings In level bars, 71 Waveform application, 68 114 PRISM Media Analysis Platform User Manual","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
