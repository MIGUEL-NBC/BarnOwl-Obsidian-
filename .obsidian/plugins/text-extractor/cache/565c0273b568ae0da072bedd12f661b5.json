The camera incorporates the latest image capturing device and digital signal-processing LSI, and it performs newly developed digital transmission with the camera control unit (CCU), thus yielding high picture quality and high stability in image creation in addition to superior camera functions and operability. 1) An HSC-300 and HXCU-100 can be connected if both units are of version 1.10 or later. Features High picture quality and high performance The latest 2/3-type Progressive IT CCD units for 2,200,000 pixel achieve high sensitivity and low smear. In addition, the 14-bit A/D converter and an original developed signal- processing LSI provide high picture quality of optimal grade. Multiple formats The camera covers 1080/59.94i, 720/59.94P, 1080/50i, and 720/50P. With its wide-range down-converter, the camera also enables output of high-quality SD signals (525i/625i) from the camera and the connected CCU, establishing an optimum camera system for SD-system operations. Newly designed integrated unit with low center of gravity The camera has stylish appearance with low-slung design. When used in combination with the HDLA1500-series large- lens adaptor, it permits a viewfinder to be mounted at a low position, making the viewfinder position closer to the optical axis of the lens. Optimized handle shape and VF slide mechanism for stable shooting A new handle design has been adopted. A slight protrusion of the upper front part of the handle enables stable holding of the camera while you are shooting, by holding the front part of the handle. Furthermore, a slide mechanism is located at the viewfinder attachment position. Any difference in weight balance caused by having a different lens attached can be counteracted by adjusting the viewfinder attachment position, in combination with the movable shoulder pad position. This provides the best balance for shooting with the camera on your shoulder. Operable in an HDLA large-lens adaptor The camera can be mounted in an HDLA1500-series large- lens adaptor. Featuring the characteristics of requiring no cable connection and no adjustments, switching between large-lens studio operation and portable operation can be easily performed, enabling flexible application with high mobility. ND/CC dual optical servo filters mounted The camera incorporates ND and CC optical servo filter units, four each, which can be remotely controlled from an external control device, such as a remote control panel (RCP) or a master setup unit (MSU). Position-adjustable shoulder pad The position of the shoulder pad can be adjusted for stable shooting according to the build of the camera operator, the type of lens in use, or the shooting style. A low-repulsion shoulder pad (position fixed) is available as an option. (Part No.: A-8286-346-A) Function-assignable switches The camera has buttons to which various functions can be assigned on the side panel and the rear. You can activate your desired function, such as electronic color-temperature conversion, instantly when shooting by assigning it to one of these buttons in advance. Buttons on the handle are also available as function assignable switches. Auto Lens Aberration Compensation function The Auto Lens Aberration Compensation function (ALAC) is provided with this camera. This automatically reduces chromatic aberration of magnification when a lens that supports auto aberration compensation is attached. For details on lenses supporting auto aberration compensation, contact a Sony sales representative or Sony service representative. Focus assist functions The VF detail function and focus assist indicator function facilitate focusing. VF detail Various functions are provided for the VF detail signal, which can be added only on images on the viewfinder screen in order to facilitate focusing in various situations: Functions for coloring the VF detail signal, flickering the VF detail signal by adding modulation, thickening the VF detail signal, and automatically compensating the VF detail level according to the zoom position. Focus Assist Indicator The focusing level indicator on the viewfinder screen provides a guide for focusing. The best focus setting can be easily determined by observing fluctuation of the level indicator as a guide. 5Overview “Memory Stick” 1) operation The camera is equipped with a “Memory Stick” port, which enables setup data storage and software upgrading using a “Memory Stick.” 1) “Memory Stick” and are trademarks of Sony Corporation. Various color-reproduction functions Selection of multiple gamma tables Seven types of standard and 4 types of hyper gamma tables are provided with this camera. The hyper gamma values enable cinemalike image creations with wide dynamic range, which are different from those achieved with conventional video gamma. Multimatrix color correction In addition to the standard 6-axis matrix function, the camera has a multimatrix function that permits you to adjust the hue and chroma for color components in 16-axis directions independently. This is quite useful in color matching among multiple cameras. Knee saturation Change of hue and decrease in chroma that occur in highlighted areas can be compensated. This enables reproduction of natural skin tones under strong lighting. Low key saturation Hue and chroma in low-key zones can be compensated. Thus, compensation for color reproduction in all zones is enabled in combination with matrix color compensation and knee saturation functions. Versatile detail control functions Skin-tone detail function This function allows control (emphasis or suppression) of the detail level for just a certain hue or chroma area in the image, by creating a detail gate signal from color components of your specified hue, such as skin tones. Detail boost-frequency control The boost frequency can be adjusted from 20 to 30 MHz. This allows the detail thickness to be set appropriately for the subject, thus enabling more subtle image expression. H/V ratio control The ratio between horizontal and vertical detail can be adjusted. White/black limiter The white and black details can be limited independently. Easy menu-based setting Selections and settings for viewfinder display items, safety- zone marker 1) or center marker, 2) screen size marker, etc. can be made quickly and easily, using setup menus displayed on the viewfinder screen or an external monitor. 1) Safety zone marker: A box-shaped marker displayed on the viewfinder screen which indicates 80%, 90%, 92.5%, or 95% of the total screen area 2) Center marker: A cross-shaped marker which indicates the center of the viewfinder screen Wide variety of viewfinder display options Along with items such as operation messages, a zebra pattern,1) a safety-zone marker, and a center marker, camera settings may also be displayed on the viewfinder screen. Furthermore, there are various cautionary and warning indications to be occasionally displayed, making it simple to check the status of the camera. 1) Zebra pattern: A stripe pattern displayed on the viewfinder screen which indicates the portions where the video level is above about 70% or 100%. Used to check the video level of the subject. Digital triax transmission The camera uses an industry standard dual-shield coaxial (triax) camera cable for connection between the camera and a CCU. Newly developed original digital transmission technology is built into the camera, and high-quality pictures can be transmitted between the camera and CCU, regardless of the cable length. Versatile choices of viewfinders Multiformat monochrome CRT viewfinders, HDVF-200 (2- type) and HDVF-550 (5-type) can be selected for use in studio and portable systems. Color LCD viewfinders, HDVF-C35W (3.5-type), HDVF- C550W (5-type), and HDVF-C730W (6.5-type), are also selectable to cover various applications. Prevention of electrical shock When the power connection is unsafe, the power supply from the connected Camera Control Unit will be shut off. 6 Overview System Configuration Peripherals and related devices for the camera are shown in figures.

This adjustment helps you get the best balance for shooting with the camera on your shoulder. To adjust 1 Raise the lever in the center of the shoulder pad to unlock the shoulder pad, 2 slide the shoulder pad backward or forward until it is in the most convenient position, and 3 move the lever down to lock the shoulder pad in the selected position. Preparatory Settings Adjusting the Black Balance and White Balance In order to maintain high picture quality when using the camera, it is necessary to set the black balance and white balance appropriately for the conditions. When a CCU or an external control device, such as an RCP/ RM or an MSU, is connected, the black balance and white balance are controlled from the external device, and adjustment on the camera is disabled. Black balance adjustment The black balance needs adjustment in situations like the following: • The first time the camera is used • When the camera is used after a long period of disuse • When the surrounding temperature changes greatly • When the gain value is changed using the setup menus Normally, there is no need to adjust the black balance every time the camera is turned on. White balance adjustment Always adjust the white balance when lighting conditions change. To adjust the black balance Push the AUTO W/B BAL switch to BLK. Automatic black balance adjustment begins. In automatic adjustment of black balance, both the black set and black balance are adjusted. During adjustment, the message “ABB: EXECUTING” will be displayed on the viewfinder screen. When the adjustment process is completed, the message “ABB: OK” will be displayed. The adjusted value is automatically stored in memory. The black balance values stored in memory will be preserved even when the camera power is turned off. • During black balance adjustment, the iris will be automatically closed. • During black balance adjustment, the gain switching circuit will work automatically, and the viewfinder screen will flicker several times. This is not a malfunction.

A white object (white cloth, a white wall, etc.) near the subject may be used in place of a white pattern. Be careful not to have any spots of high illumination in the rectangle. 3 Adjust the lens iris opening. With a manually adjusted lens: Set the opening to an appropriate value. With a lens which has automatic iris control: Set the lens’ automatic/manual iris control switch to automatic. 4 Select white balance memory A or B with the WHITE BAL switch and push the AUTO W/B BAL switch toward WHT. Automatic white balance adjustment begins. During adjustment, the message “AWB: EXECUTING” will be displayed on the viewfinder screen. After about one second, the message “AWB: OK” will be displayed, and the adjustment process will complete. The adjusted value will be automatically stored in the selected memory (A or B). When using a zoom lens with automatic iris control capability, hunting1) may occur. Adjust the lens’ iris gain control (labeled IG, IS, S, etc.). 1) Hunting: The automatic iris responds over and over, and the image repeatedly darkens and lightens. For more information, refer to the operation manual for the lens. About white balance memory There are two white balance memories: A and B. When you execute automatic white balance adjustment, the adjusted white balance value and the settings of the filter select knobs will be stored in either memory A or B, selected with the WHITE BAL switch. The white balance values stored in memory will be preserved even when power is turned off. When power is turned on again, the white balance in memory corresponding to the current WHITE BAL switch setting is retrieved. By setting FILTER WHT MEM to ON on the <OTHERS 2> page of the MAINTENANCE menu, you can store a white balance value for each of the built-in CC filters in memory A and B individually. In this case, a total of 8 white balance values can be stored as the camera has four CC filters. The settings of the filter select knobs are not stored when you adjust white balance with FILTER WHT MEM set to ON. In this case, the white balance in memory corresponding to the current WHITE BAL switch and CC filter select knob settings is retrieved when power is turned on again. If automatic black balance or white balance adjustment fails If the adjustment process does not end successfully, the error message “ABB: NG” or “AWB: NG” will be displayed on the viewfinder screen for approximately three seconds. If this error message is displayed, try the adjustment again. If the error message continues to be displayed after several attempts, the camera requires internal inspection.

About the shutter modes The shutter modes that can be used with the electronic shutter of the camera and the shutter speeds that may be selected are as follows: 1) The values in the table are those with 59.94i. With other formats, the available values may be different. With artificial lighting, particularly fluorescent lights and mercury vapor lamps, the brightness appears to be constant, but in fact the strength of the red, green, and blue components varies with the power supply frequency. This phenomenon is known as “flicker.” When using the electronic shutter under these lighting conditions, there are certain cases in which the flicker is more noticeable. In particular, color flicker is evident when the power frequency is 60 Hz. In areas where the power frequency is 50 Hz, setting the shutter speed to 1/100 second will reduce the flicker. Selecting the mode and speed of the shutter The mode and the shutter speed in Standard mode are set using the SHUTTER switch. 1 Push the SHUTTER switch from the ON position to the SEL position. The current shutter setting will be displayed in the viewfinder for about three seconds. Example: “Shutter: 1/250” 2 Push the SHUTTER switch to the SEL position again before the display disappears. Repeat this action until the desired mode or speed is displayed. Setting the Local Time When using the camera for the first time, set the built-in clock to the local time, using the <DATE> page of the MAINTENANCE menu displayed on the viewfinder screen.

Appendices Precautions Note on laser beams Laser beams may damage the CCDs. If you shoot a scene that includes a laser beam, be careful not to let a laser beam become directed into the lens of the camera. Do not subject to severe shocks Damage to the case or internal components may result. When finished using Set the power switch to OFF. Operation and storage environment Store in a level place with air conditioning. If the unit gets wet, make sure it is completely dry before storage. Avoid use or storage in the following places: • Extremely hot or cold places • Places with high humidity • Places with strong vibration • Near strong magnetic fields • In places where it receives much direct sunlight, or near heating equipment Condensation If you move the camera from a very cold place to a warm place, or use it in a damp location, condensation may form on the lens or inside the camera. The camera has no built-in condensation indicator. If you find condensation on the body or lens, switch the camera off and wait for the condensation to disappear for about one hour. Phenomena specific to CCD image sensors The following phenomena that may appear in images are specific to CCD (Charge Coupled Device) image sensors. They do not indicate malfunctions. White flecks Although the CCD image sensors are produced with high- precision technologies, fine white flecks may be generated on the screen in rare cases, caused by cosmic rays. This is related to the principle of CCD image sensors and is not a malfunction. The white flecks especially tend to be seen • when operating at a high environmental temperature • when you have raised the master gain (sensitivity) This product has a compensation function and the problem may be alleviated by automatic black balance adjustment (see page 16). Smear When an extremely bright object, such as a strong spotlight or flashlight, is being shot, vertical tails may be produced on the screen, or the image may be distorted.

About digital triax transmission A powerful error-correction function is incorporated for the transmission between the camera and CCU. However, if an error occurs on long-distance transmission because of external noise or for some other reason, the compensation by interpolation that partially uses the previous picture may operate. In digital triax transmission, the following video delay in transmission may occur: • The video delay in transmission between the camera and the CCU is approx. 9 msec to 12 msec. • A delay of about 1 frame occurs on the viewfinder display if a camera image is sent back from the CCU to the camera as a return signal. • The prompter video will delay approx. 5 frames in the standard mode. (For the prompter video, either the standard mode or the low-delay mode using simplified images can be selected on the CCU). • An appropriate delay is applied to the MIC 1 and 2 audio signals from the CCU according to the video delay. • It takes a certain time until the video signal transmitted between the camera and the CCU becomes stable after power is applied. This is not a malfunction. About the distances of triax transmission (when an HSCU-300 is connected) The maximum and minimum transmission distances allowed for triax cable connection are shown in the table below. The distances may vary according to the conditions, such as the total power requirements (including the power supply to the camera from the CCU) and cable degradation. Allowable transmission range when using triax cables with the following characteristics: Attenuation: 3.8 dB to 68.4 dB at 100 MHz (including the loss at connectors) 1) If the transmission distance exceeds approximately 7/9 of the maximum transmission distance, the teleprompter transmitted image quality starts to deteriorate. 2) The maximum distance will be 650 m (2133 ft) when the total power for the lens, viewfinder and utility outputs is between 100 and 120 W. About the distances of triax transmission (when an HXCU-100 is connected) The maximum and minimum transmission distances allowed for triax cable connection are shown in the table below. The distances may vary according to the conditions, such as cable degradation. Allowable transmission range when using triax cables with the following characteristics: Attenuation: 3.8 dB to 45.6 dB at 100 MHz (including the loss at connectors) Cable (for example) Max. distance1) Min. distance Fujikura 8.5-mm dia. 900 m (2953 ft) 2) 50 m (164 ft) Fujikura 14.5-mm dia. 1800 m (5906 ft) 100 m (328 ft) Belden 9232 13.2-mm dia 1350 m (4265 ft) 75 m (246 ft) Cable (for example) Max. distance Min. distance Fujikura 8.5-mm dia. 600 m (1969 ft) 50 m (164 ft) Fujikura 14.5-mm dia. 1200 m (3937 ft) 100 m (328 ft) Belden 9232 13.2-mm dia 850 m (2789 ft) 75 m (246 ft) 39Appendices Error Messages If a problem occurs during operation, a warning message is displayed.
