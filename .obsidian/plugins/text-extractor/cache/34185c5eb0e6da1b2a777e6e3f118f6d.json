{"path":"To Be Organized/Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Touch/Touch.docx","text":"Touch Touchscreens are set up with an Intel NUC PC that is stored and moves with the screen it controls. There are options for different devices: Viz Interactive, Digital Interactive (Videoflow), and Weather. Important Note: On versions of Windows with Touch functionality, if the user swipes from the last hand side of the screen towards the center, it will slide dzw123 a menu. You cannot see this menu on the touch screen as the video source is routed into it, but it will cover the right hand side of the screen and overlay the TUIO app. If this happens, touch controls on the right side, such as weather hits, will not work. You will need to remote into the machine and click out of the touch menu to regain functionality. Users need to be conscious not to swipe from the right edge. Important! There have been changes regarding how Digital Interactive hits function, and are loaded. Chrome must be version 69 or older for Digital Interactive hits or there will be problems controlling slideshows in the app. Do not update at this time. Viz and Weather touch both use the TUIO application to send touch data to the machines that actually render and playout graphics. The client IP address is the address of the rendering machine, whether it is a Viz Engine or Weather PC. The streamer is the IP address of a physical PC that displays a direct preview on the touch PC. If the preview is not working, the touch will still work. For weather machines, the TUIO application must also be running on the machine that is loading the weather hit. Digital Interactive runs natively in a browser on the PC using the VideoFlow shortcut.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
