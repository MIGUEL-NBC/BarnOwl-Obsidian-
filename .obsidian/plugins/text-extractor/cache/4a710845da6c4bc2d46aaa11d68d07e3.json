The IP addresses can be found at https://nbcuni.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/GFXTechnology/EZcv_WlSloVEiCkgqNOV_tcBOWhN0zBu6E1eQ3RYj QVYCw?e=c2etsx but channel assignments can change as the system is fully routable. Always check Magnum SDVN or a control room “far” UMD to confirm the physical playout device that is feeding a CR DDR. Procedure: 1. From a jumpbox, open a web browser (Chrome recommended) and go the IP of the server from the spreadsheet linked above. 2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page under power management and click “Reboot” 3. The other restart types can fix issues but the Reboot has been proven to solve most issues. If an issue persists, try rebooting again WHILE escalating the issue. a. Also note that for GUI-only issues like a status not refreshing or a frozen widget, a VUE restart can be performed by holding CTRL+ALT+R 4. Once the server comes back up (~4 minutes), video playout and audio should be validated on all channels that were rebooted by working with the TD and audio op. If the server restarted was the GUI display (Usually DDRs 1-4) also validate that GUI control of the 12 other channels persists. a.
