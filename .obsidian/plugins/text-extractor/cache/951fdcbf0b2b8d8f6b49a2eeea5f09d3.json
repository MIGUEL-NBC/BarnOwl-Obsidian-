With its Ethernet networking and comprehensive interface connections, the 7700R-SC-BRC provides a platform to manage third party communication and interface requirements for routing systems. The module is designed to allow bi-directional (where required) communication between Evertz® routers and control systems and third party systems (like third party router controllers, third party routers, automation systems, production switchers etc), and can be conﬁ gured to allow Evertz® to control third party devices and/or to allow third party devices to control Evertz® devices. Name data for router control system (often referred to as mnemonics) can be transferred from Evertz® router control systems into the 7700R-SC- BRC and are available to third party systems using a protocol that supports mnemonic transfer. SNMP monitoring support via VLPRO allows efﬁ cient monitoring and conﬁ guration of the 7700R-SC-BRC system controller. The 7700R-SC-BRC is a 2-slot module and can be housed in the 1RU 7701FR frame that holds up to three single or dual slot modules, the 3RU 7800FR frame that has a 15-slot capacity, the portable 3RU 350FR frame that has a 7-slot capacity, or a standalone enclosure that holds a single module. Evertz ® control of 3rd party routers and router control systems 3rd party control of Evertz ® routers and router control systems Speciﬁ cations Connector: RJ45 10/100Mb Ports: 2 Serial Ports: Number of Ports: 3 (RS-232/RS422) Connector: Female BD25 7700R-SC-BRCETH1RS-232/RS-422 (UART 1,2,3) 1 2 3 4ETH2 Control/ Indications Evertz Control Third Party Control Third Party Router / Controller Third Party Control Device Third Party protocol Third Party protocol Serial (UART 3) Or IP Serial (UART 1) Or IP MAGNUM Evertz Router / MAGNUM Quartz Protocol Quartz Protocol IP Serial (UART 2) Or IP Rev. 15-1 System Controller, Single Processor 7700R-SC-BRC 7700R-SC-BRC System Controller, single processor Ordering Options: Rear Plate Sufﬁ x +1RU 1RU rear plate for use with 7701FR Multiframe +SA Standalone Enclosure Rear Plate +3RU 3RU rear plate for use with 350FR, 7700FR-C or 7800FR Multiframes Enclosures 350FR Portable Multiframe which holds 7 single slot modules 7700FR-C 3RU Multiframe which holds 15 single slot modules 7800FR 3RU Multiframe which holds 15 single slot modules 7701FR 1RU Multiframe which holds 3 single slot modules S7701FR 7700 Series Standalone Enclosure Ordering Information Third Party Control of Evertz ® Routers/Magnum Control System Product Protocol Format Snell kahuna production switcher (Natively Supports Quartz Protocol, no 7700R-SC-BRC required) Serial Avid capture manager GVG-RCL Both Sony MVS-8000 production switcher Sony ROT16 (SONY HKSP-R80 to convert S-BUS to ROT16 required) Ethernet Wheatstone audio console (Natively Supports Quartz Protocol, no 7700R-SC-BRC required) Serial Thomson GVG kalyspo production switcher SMS7000 (GVNP -
