{"path":"To Be Organized/Graphics Documentation/VIZ PILOT PLUGIN TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE.docx","text":"VIZ PILOT PLUGIN TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE Note: The share folder: \\\\artworksnyc.nbcuni.ge.com\\vizrt_onair must be mapped to the Q drive and you must be able to navigate the folder structure from within File Explorer. Pilot will function to a degree without the Q drive, so please verify during troubleshooting. Users should also be connected to the GlobalProtect Gateway: test-ec2, and have an internet connection faster than 10 Mbps. Regardless of speed, if the user is on wi-fi, try to troubleshoot with a wired connection as some wi-fi connections can still cause problems. The current version of Viz Pilot is available for install from the Software Center. Having the user uninstall and reinstall the plugin is a common troubleshooting step. Pilot is opened in iNews via the Tools>Plugins menu, and opens as a frame inside of iNews. In the Templates tab, you can dropdown the Concept to see different shows, on the left you will see all the templates in that Concept. On the right hand side are the completed templates saved by end-users. The Media tab shows clips available in the Viz One system that can be loaded into templates. Double-click a template name to open it. Templates are created and managed by Real Time Graphics. Here you will see all the fields available to the user. In some cases, a field may be missing or not act as expected, if this is present when you look at the template as well, it’s most likely an RTG issue. Please note the “Go to: Dali” button in the templates does not function, and users should open Dali from the Plugins menu. On the top right there are several icons, the first is Save, then the ‘eye’ icon will display the preview for the current template, followed by Info and Back. In templates that can load images, there are a few options. Dali Image. Dali access is managed by @NBC UNI Dali Admins. When users have the Dali iNews plugin open as well as Pilot, they can drag an image directly from Dali into the “Get Image” thumbnail. This will show a red outline for a moment while the thumbnail loads. If the drag and drop function fails, the user may receive an error message, or it will show a “NO” icon. In the latter case the user is most likely trying to drag from Dali in a web browser rather than from the iNews plugin. ‘Image File’, which adds the ‘browse’ folder button to the thumbnail. We recommend the file originate from the Q drive to rule out networking issues, the user could try that if they’re having trouble uploading. Some templates will load an image cropping tool as part of the upload, when the user crops the image and saves it, it will put the files into the Q drive under cropped_images or cropped_images_2. If the file doesn’t actually make it to the Q drive (possible network issues) it will be unavailable when the gfx op tries to play it out. You can see the name of the file and its location by hovering over the folder icon in the thumbnail. If not, follow normal troubleshooting steps. If you can recreate the issue on your PC, it is most likely a backend problem and should be escalated. If it works on your PC, first try general steps, ie. Restart When opening Preview, Pilot sends the template information to one of the Viz Frame Servers (preview servers) which renders the graphic and sends it back to the users preview window. Slow or high latency connections may prevent the rendered image to fully load and the green loading bar will load infinitely, verify the users connection is fast enough (over 10 Mbps generally) and stable (use ethernet if at all possible), and confirm user is connected to test-ec2. If the window says “disconnected” in the bottom right, verify all frame servers are on with Viz Engine running and make sure Engine is not frozen (try minimizing, if the application hangs, close and restart Engine.) Viz Pilot will only connect to a new frame server when iNews is closed and restarted, so the quickest way to get someone up may be to have them restart iNews so it will connect to a working frame server. Once a template is finished, the user will Save, name their custom template, and an icon will appear in the top left of the Template. This is a draggable icon and is dragged from the template into an iNews story. This addition is reflected on the Trio that rundown is loaded in. If this function does not work, find out if it is affecting all users or not. If it is, please escalate. If only one user is affected, a PC reboot will usually solve this. There is a Viz Pilot Configuration app located in: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Vizrt\\Viz Pilot 8.4\\Configuration\\PilotConfiguration.exe This specifies the Pilot Database and Preview Settings. The settings in this image are correct for the database: For Preview settings, the default setting is blank and Override database settings is unchecked. This will point Viz Pilot to the Frame Server pool. If you want to connect Pilot to a specific frame server for troubleshooting, check Override database settings, and enter the IP address or hostname for the frame server of your choice, and 6100 as the port. The current frame servers are: 100.113.83.60, and 100.113.83.61 and they are located in 2F.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
