{"path":"To Be Organized/Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Viz One/How to verify Viz One delivery to engines.docx","text":"Note:Viz One functions differently on vprod (ACI Network) engines, as clips are streamed from network storage rather than copied to the local engine. In the event of bad playback such as stuttering, or the clip taking hits, it is possible to manually copy the necessary clips onto the local drive. Double Note: For vprod engines, in the clip Item under Files, you will not see the engines the file has been sent to as it does not copy them locally. Each engine, including Multiplays, stores its content on the V: drive. The V:\\Clips folder contains all clips that have been delivered to the engine from Viz One. Viz One has its own naming scheme and will rename files so you must access the Viz One dashboard to find a particular clip. After logging in you can go to items and search for the clip you need to verify, for example, 21186029 1a wall Flags in Blizzard.mov. Click into the clip item, and you can find the Viz One ID for it, in this case \"OOFGYUDBCPGUMVEL.\" This is what you would look for in the V:\\Clips folder. Note: As noted previously, you will not find these clips on the V:\\Clips local folder on vprod engines by default. They are located on the network in \\\\gfxflash01.vprod.io\\clipcache\\vizrt\\vizone\\playback1 If there is an issue with streaming playback you can then copy the necessary clip (or all clips past a certain date) to the local V:\\Clips folder.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
