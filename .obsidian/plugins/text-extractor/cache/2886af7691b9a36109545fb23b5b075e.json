Make sure the Data Hub is running via the orange icon in the task bar. If it's grey, you can right click to start it. Use the Data Hub Launcher icon to start the application if it is not running. The Feed Streamer is the application that shows you pending and approved tweets for each tag. For example, producers can use the RTG Portal to select content from tags displayed here on the left hand side to be sent to the Orange Room Dashboard. If they say nothing is showing up, you can verify here if there is any approved content on the right hand side. It has happened that the tag that was selected in the RTG Portal just turned out to be empty. If they are having an issue and you open the Feed Streamer and it does NOT load, and you receive a 'cannot connect' error, run the cleanindex.bat file on the desktop. This will perform some maintenance and restart the services automatically. Then open Feed Streamer again to see if everything populates.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
