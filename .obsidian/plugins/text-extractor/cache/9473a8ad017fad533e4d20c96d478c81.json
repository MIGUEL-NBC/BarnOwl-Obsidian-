M/E Block The 24-channel signals from the cross point block are input to the M/E block of the MVS-8000X, and 11-channel (10-channel for M/E2 and M/E3) signals are returned to the cross point block as output. The 32-channel signals from the cross point block are input to the M/E block of the MVS-7000X, and 18-channel (16-channel for M/E2) signals are returned to the cross point block as output. The M/E block sends/receives dedicated signals to be input from and output to the MVE to/from the DME interface block. Consistent M/E processing is performed on the MIX-53 board of the MVS-8000X/7000X. MIX-53 board (MVS-8000X/7000X, MKS-8210X, MKS-7210X) The MIX-53 board consists of the following blocks. . SDI input cross point block . SDI input/output block . Key process block . Wipe/color background signal generator block . Mixer block . Resizer block The MIX-53 board is controlled by the local CPU module (CPU-DP) on the board. [SDI input cross point block]: IC1901 to IC1904. This block selects the key signal sent from the cross point block (XPT board) and sends the selected key signal to the SDI input block (IC2, IC3). [SDI input/output block]: IC2 to IC6 This block converts the serial SDI signal sent from the cross point block (XPT board) or the SDI input cross point block to parallel signal, and sends the parallel signal to the key process block and the mixer block. This block eliminates phase differences of input signals and performs video processing (including video level adjustment for each input). Furthermore, this block converts the signal sent from the mixer block to SDI signal, and sends the SDI signal to the cross point block (XPT board) and the rear board (CNO board). [Key process block]: IC7, IC8 This block performs key processing for the Luminance key, Linear key, Chroma key, etc. and mask processing based on the signal from the SDI input block and the wipe signal generated by the color background signal generator through the mixer block, and then sends the processed signals to the mixer block. [Wipe/color background signal generator block]: IC10 This block generates the wipe signal and the color background signal, and sends them to the mixer block. [Mixer block]: IC9 The mixer block compounds the signal sent directly from the SDI input/output block, the KEY signal sent from the key process block, and the wipe signal sent from the wipe/color background signal generator block to generate the M/E.P/P output signal. This block sends the color background signal to the SDI input/output block without processing it. When applying the DME effect, the target signal is output from the mixer block and is sent to the MVE interface block. The signal to which effect was applied through the DME is returned again to the mixer block and is compounded with other signals. This block also sends video/key signals to the resizer circuit (simple DME function) and receives return video/key signals from the resizer circuit. [Resizer block]: IC11, IC12 This block applies resizer effects to the signal sent from the mixer block, and sends the signal to which resizer effects were applied to the mixer block. Main effects are shown below. (1) Enlargement, reduction, shift, aspect (2) Crop, border (3) Mosaic, edge enhance, defocus (4) Mask, drop shadow, wide key boarder (One of these is selected.)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
