www.telemetricsinc.com 1 Introduction The RCCP-1 Robotic Camera Control Panel allows one or more operators to remotely control an unlimited number of camera stations, including peripheral devices such as lights, audio mixers, or recording devices from one or more local or remote locations. Camera stations consist of a broadcast camera, a Telemetrics pan and tilt head, other robotic camera positioning hardware, and additional devices (such as lighting) and electronics. Many different types of cameras, pan and tilt heads, robotic camera positioning hardware, and devices can be included in the system. Overview of a Typical Installation Typical Network Installation In a typical network installation where many camera stations are controlled from one or more remote locations, Telemetrics RCCP-1 devices are connected to a network of camera stations and Telemetrics Enterprise Database Control Software (EDCS) by direct ethernet and Telemetrics Device Servers DS-4 (Figure 1). Figure 1 Typical Network Installation RCCP-1 Camera Control System User’s Manual www.telemetricsinc.com rev 11/16 2 Typical Smaller Installation In smaller local installations, pan and tilt heads and cameras can be directly linked to the Telemetrics RCCP-1 by means of direct ethernet and a Telemetrics Device Server DS-4 (Figure 2). Figure 2 Typical Smaller Installation Installation Components Virtually all types of broadcast cameras can be included in the system. The same joystick, buttons, and knobs on the RCCP-1 are used to control each camera station, and the controls that are displayed on the RCCP-1 touch screen for each type of camera emulate the remote operating panel provided by the manufacturer of that camera. However, the user interface for selecting presets and controlling camera settings is similar for all cameras, allowing operators to readily utilize the RCCP-1 for controlling every camera station. One or more external video switchers are usually connected to the camera stations to provide a preview to a remote operator. In addition, controls for peripheral devices (such as audio mixers or lighting equipment) that are linked to one or more camera stations can be obtained from Telemetrics. Introduction rev 11/16 www.telemetricsinc.com 3 Shows, Shots, and Camera Settings The Telemetrics RCCP-1 enables the operator to control all of the camera stations and their devices for a show and to specify and recall specific shots (also called presets) within the show. A show is the collection of cameras and other devices and their settings that have been specified and saved for use in a specific type of program or audio-visual presentation. Any user with assigned access privileges can subsequently recall a saved show for controlling the cameras and devices that are assigned to that show. A shot is the collection of settings for the currently selected camera. A shot specifies the pan, tilt, zoom, focus, iris and master pedestal positions, shot speed, and settings for other devices on the camera station such as a lens extender. Displaying Show Information Using the Telemetrics Studio Application The optional Telemetrics Studio System utilizes an additional story board touch monitor to display thumbnails of all of the shots in the current show. The screen on the Basic RCCP-1 Control Panel contains the information, controls, and indicators used during operation of each camera and peripheral device, while the story board touch monitor displays the various camera shots that have been created for a show, enabling the operator to readily view and manage these shots (Figure 3). Figure 3 The Telemetrics Studio System Screen for the Telemetrics RCCP-1 Basic Control Panel Story Board Screen for the Telemetrics RCCP-1 Studio System RCCP-1 Camera Control System User’s Manual www.telemetricsinc.com rev 11/16 4 Remote Control Panel (RCCP-1) Hardware Components The Telemetrics RCCP-1 utilizes a joystick, rocker, trackpad, knobs, pushbuttons, and a touch screen to control camera operations (Figure 4). • The touch screen displays the connection status, information, and settings for the currently selected camera, provides on-screen controls for switching camera functions on or off and changing camera settings, and provides on-screen controls that duplicate the functions of the joystick, rotary knobs, rocker, and pushbuttons. • The trackpad can be used instead of a mouse for positioning the pointer or cursor on the screen and selecting an item. • The camera setting knobs are used to control focus, iris, master black, and camera settings. • The joystick is used to control camera pan and tilt, camera lens zoom, and camera elevation and/or position. • The joystick speed knob is used to adjust the speed at which the joystick operates for each function. • The joystick speed indicator is used to indicate which joystick speed setting is being changed and the current setting. • The operation pushbuttons are used to enter a shot, specify how the camera settings knobs are used, fade, and display menus for additional functions. • The camera/preset selection pushbuttons are used to select a camera and/or to save and recall preset shots. • The rocker is used to control camera elevation and/or position. • The focus knob is used to control focus. Figure 4 Telemetrics Remote Control Panel (RCCP-1) Components Joystick Speed Indicator Joystick Speed Knob Focus Knob Joystick Operation Pushbuttons Camera/Preset Selection Pushbuttons Rocker Trackpad Touch Screen Camera Settings Knobs Camera Settings Knobs Introduction rev 11/16 www.telemetricsinc.com 5 Trackpad The trackpad can be used instead of a mouse for positioning the pointer or cursor on the screen. The R and L buttons adjacent to the trackpad are used for selecting (clicking) an item. The pointer or cursor can also be directly positioned and an item directly selected using the touchscreen. Camera Settings Knobs Two of the camera settings knobs control master pedestal and iris settings for the currently selected camera. • Master Pedestal: Changes the camera master pedestal setting, enabling the operator to set the black level for the darkest part of the image. Rotate the knob clockwise to increase the black level, or rotate the knob counter-clockwise to decrease the black level. • Iris: Changes the camera lens aperture to compensate for lighting. Rotate the knob clockwise to increase (open) the aperture (or increase the intensity, or rotate the knob counter-clockwise to decrease the aperture. Functions of the remaining six knobs are specified by the user (see page 15 for details). The currently selected function of each knob and its current setting are displayed on the touch screen adjacent to each knob (Figure 5). Figure 5 Display of Knob Functions and Values Master Pedestal Iris Knob Function and Setting User- Assigned User- Assigned RCCP-1 Camera Control System User’s Manual www.telemetricsinc.com rev 11/16 6 Joystick The joystick allows the operator to control the pan and tilt, zoom, and elevation and/or position of a camera with one hand. Moving the joystick in the forward and reverse directions changes the tilt of the camera station, and moving the joystick in the left and right directions changes the pan of the camera station. The joystick directions can be reversed to accommodate operator preferences. Refer to page 55 for details. Rotating the upper portion of the joystick causes the zoom to increase or decrease. Rotating the joystick in the clockwise direction causes the zoom to increase, and rotating the joystick in the counter-clockwise direction causes the zoom to decrease. The upper portion of the joystick is spring-loaded, and releasing it causes the zoom setting to revert to the nominal position. Pressing the button on top of the joystick enables the operator to control the elevation and/or position of a camera. Moving the joystick in the forward and reverse directions while pressing the button changes the height of the camera station, and moving the joystick in the left and right directions changes the position of the camera station. Joystick Speed Knob and Joystick Parameter and Speed Indicators When the joystick speed knob is pressed in the direction of the arrows marked SELECT, the Joystick Speeds dialog box (see page 68 for more information) is displayed showing the current speeds for changing pan and tilt, zoom, focus, camera height, and position (Figure 6). Figure 6 Display of the Joystick Speeds Dialog Box Joystick Speed Knob Joystick Speed Indicator Joystick Speeds Dialog Box Joystick Parameter Indicator Introduction rev 11/16 www.telemetricsinc.com 7 Whenever the Joystick Speed dialog box is displayed, the speed for one of the joystick parameters (for example, Pan) is highlighted in the dialog box. The row corresponding to the highlighted parameter is also illuminated in the A column of the Joystick Parameter Indicator (Figure 6). Rotating the joystick speed knob in the direction marked + increases the speed for the highlighted parameter, while rotating the joystick speed knob in the direction marked – decreases the speed. The speed is displayed in the highlighted field of the Joystick Speed dialog box and is also indicated by the height of illuminated sections in the B column of the Joystick Parameter Indicator (Figure 6) Pressing the joystick speed knob a second time in the direction of the arrows marked SELECT while the Joystick Speeds dialog box is displayed advances the highlighted. section to the next joystick parameter. Selecting the DIR (direction) field for a highlighted parameter changes the direction in which the joystick operates for that parameter from STD (standard) to REV (reverse) or vice-versa. Camera Selection Pushbuttons The camera selection pushbuttons (Figure 7) are used to select a camera (page 61). The camera selection pushbuttons are color-coded: • If a pushbutton is red, that camera is on the air. • If a pushbutton is green, that camera is selected. • If a pushbutton is orange, that camera is selected and on the air. Figure 7 Pushbuttons on the Keypad Camera Selection Pushbuttons Operation Pushbuttons Function Pushbutton RCCP-1 Camera Control System User’s Manual www.telemetricsinc.com rev 11/16 8 Operation Pushbuttons The operation pushbuttons (Figure 7) are used for the following functions: Pushbutton Function Enter a shot (page 73) Specify user-assigned camera control knobs (page 71) , or 1) Perform a fade 2) Perform a cut 3) (Basic RCCP-1 Control Panel only) Display the Shots panel (page 71) or 1) Start the RCCP-1 when it is shut down. 2) Display the EDIT menu for performing administrative actions (page 55) Rocker The rocker allows the operator to control camera elevation and/or position. Moving the rocker in the forward and reverse directions changes the elevation of the camera station, and moving the rocker in the left and right directions changes the position of the camera station. Focus Knob The focus knob allows the operator to change the focus of the camera lens. Rotating the focus knob clockwise focuses on a more distant object, while rotating the focus knob counter-clockwise focuses on a nearer object. The speed at which pan, tilt, zoom, and focus settings are changed is proportional to the deflection or rotation of the joystick (for pan, tilt and zoom), deflection of the rocker (for camera positioning), or the rotation of the focus knob (for focus).

Using Telemetrics Enterprise Database Control Software (EDCS) Telemetrics Enterprise Database Control Software (EDCS) provides enterprise-level camera control for a professional camera system by utilizing a SQL database with configurable access control. With the EDCS software, all aspects of a robotics camera control are managed for the entire system. The EDCS system works with Next Generation Control panels to control all data aspects. The EDCS provides for seamless operation between multiple controllers. User and device settings are accessible from any control location, and up-to-date robotics and camera settings are immediately available on the controller. All system setups are navigable from a standard browser, creating a flexible management environment but maintaining security. When Telemetrics EDCS is used in a camera control network, the network address of the EDCS server is entered during configuration of each RCCP-1 control panel (page 31). Connecting the RCCP-1 and the Story Board Screen to the Power Source Grounding of the RCCP-1, the story board screen, and those surfaces the user can come into contact with is provided by grounded cables in accordance with Protection Class I (IEC). For protection against electrical shock hazards, each device must be directly connected to an approved power source such as a 3-wire grounded receptacle. Where an ungrounded receptacle is encountered, a qualified electrician must replace it with a properly grounded receptacle in accordance with the facility electrical code. An extension cord must not be used. RCCP-1 Camera Control System User’s Manual www.telemetricsinc.com rev 11/16 28 If a power cable becomes cracked, frayed, broken, or otherwise damaged, it must be replaced immediately with the equivalent part from Telemetrics. Any break in the electrical ground path, whether inside or outside the RCCP-1, may create a hazardous condition. Under no circumstances should the user attempt to modify or deliberately defeat the safety features of the RCCP-1. 1. Obtain the AC power converter provided with the RCCP-1 and (if the RCCP-1 Studio System is installed) the AC power converter provided with the story board screen. 2. Make all of the Ethernet cable connections and all of the connections to the USB peripherals as described on the previous pages. If the RCCP-1 Studio System is installed, connect the video terminal and the USB terminal to the RCCP-1 using the supplied cables. DO NOT POWER THE UNIT ON UNTIL ALL CONNECTIONS ARE MADE. REPEATEDLY POWERING THE UNIT ON/OFF WITHOUT COMPLETING THE BOOT PROCESS MAY DAMAGE THE UNIT. 3.
