Hi Ross,
To preface, this issue is technically resolved and everything (as it stands) is functional.

We got a call today from our Robo Operator at Station 2 working on Maddow. She was remote from her home location.
Operator said that he could not control her remote Pansonic PTZ camera through the Ross system.

The operator CAN still connect to the camera in smartshell and it shows green for successful connection but the camera was unresponsive to his input commands on the joystick controller.

When connecting with Telemetrix and using Telemetrix joystick controller the operator is able to control camera fully.

Eric F. and I looked at this in 3S Video with the operator and managed to regain remote control of the camera by resetting the Furio Gateway from within the Ross dashboard.
 
I have uploaded the logs for the below event to the Ross ticket website at the folder below.
