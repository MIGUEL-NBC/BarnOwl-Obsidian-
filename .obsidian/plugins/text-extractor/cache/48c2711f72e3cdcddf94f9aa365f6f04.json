The MPU-302B board is connected to the DIO-78 board via the PCI bus. The DVO signal output from the MPU-302B board is used to display the graphics on the Menu Panel (MKS-8011). The power supply voltage +5 V and the ATX power supply voltages 5 V_ATX and 3.3 V_ATX are supplied from the CA- 57 board. The internal LAN is the interface to communicate with the CA-57 board within the unit (MKS-8010A), hence the input or output signal (data) is not sent outside of the unit. The HDD on the board stores the data such as contents of the frame memory and various setup data.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
