CA-54CFC Board The CA-54CFC board has the following functions. · Generate clock and timing signals synchronized with the reference signal and send them to the other boards. · Control LAN (connector “CTRL”)/Data LAN (connector “DATA”) data communication. · RS-422 data communication (connectors “REMOTE1 to 4”) · GPI input/output · Application software control and data management · Total system control The CA-54CFC board consists of the following boards. · CA-54CFC board itself · SG-272 board · DIF-130 board · SIO-25EF board · Main CPU module (CPU-DR or CPU-DT) · CPU-DK module for Control LAN (COM CPU-1) · CPU-DK module for Data LAN (COM CPU-2) The CA-54CFC board has three CPU modules: a main CPU module (CPU-DR or CPU-DT)for total control of the system and for GPI input/output, and two CPU-DK modules for data communication with the Control LAN (connector “CTRL”) and Data LAN (connector “DATA”). Each CPU-DK module is equipped with two RS-422 communication ports. The total system control is performed through the local CPUs and the Dual Port RAMs on the DVP-30A and VIF-32 boards. The CA-54CFC board itself executes the functions of the above-described child boards and modules, and outputs various kinds of information (such as FAN ERR signal, power information, reference signal information, and communication-related information) to the other boards for indicator display or as output data. The CA-54CFC board also supports Ethernet and RS-422 data communications. The DIP switches S102 and S103 on this board are used for setting ID (IP address, etc.) and other items. Power voltages 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V are supplied to each block. The SG-272 board mounted on the CA-54CFC board mainly generates horizontal sync pulse HD and vertical sync pulse VD, field information FLOE, register load pulse CKX, clock signal HFCK, and analog reference signals that are synchronized with the external reference signals. The main processor (IC113) that controls the functions of this board is automatically programmed by the PROM (IC302) when the power is turned on. The processor is controlled by the main CPU that rewrites its register through the local bus to change the reference signal phase and the output signal phase. The SG-272 board supports both the HD (1080i) and SD (525/625) signal formats. The reference signal status can be monitored with the LEDs (D100, 101, 200) on this board and with the LEDs (D601, 602) on the CA-54CFC board. This board also generates power voltages 5 V, 3.3 V, and 1.8 V from the 12 V supplied by the CA-54CFC board. The DIF-130 board mounted on the CA-54CFC board has functions to interface with and to control the compact flash card on this board. The flash card contains the MVE system program and the configuration data of the FPGAs mounted on each board. The DIF-130 board is controlled by the CPU-DK module (COM CPU 2) on the CA-54CFC board through the PCI bus. The controller (IC1) on this board takes charge of the interface and control between the PCI bus and the flash card. This board is equipped with sockets A and B for compact flash cards. The compact flash card that stores data required to start up the MVE system is always inserted into the socket A. The socket B is reserved for data copying or other purposes. The 3.3 V power is supplied from the CA-54CFC board. The SIO-25EF board mounted on the CA-54CFC board performs RS-422 data communication using the 4-channel SIO controller (IC102, 111, 118, 126). The SIO controller sends/receives data to/from the main CPU through the Dual Port RAM (IC101, 110, 117, 125) for parallel-to- serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions. 2. VIF-32 Board The VIF-32 board equipped with video input/output processing and video effect functions consists of a control block and a signal processing block. In the control block, the sub CPU (CPU-DR or CPU-DT) receives commands from the main CPU (on the CA-54CFC board) through the Dual Port RAM (IC1101) to control the signal processing block through the FPGA IF (IC603). The sub CPU starts up by booting the flash memory in the module, and then runs the applications upon the second boot of the flash RAM (IC1201) on this board. The boot PLD (IC601) performs configuration of the signal processing block FPGA and the FPGA on the IF-962 board (MKE-8021A), using the address decoding to the peripheral devices of the sub CPU and the configuration flash memory (IC1202) data. Configuration data and applications to be stored in the flash memory are rewritten at every startup when the corresponding data in the compact flash card of the main CPU has been updated. The signal processing block processes 4-channel data of video/key signals in parallel. The five FPGAs perform input/output processing (TBC1 to 4) such as switchover from the external clock, recursive effect, 4-channel composite processing, and graphics display (VMIX) such as wire frame. The signal flows are as follows: Video/key input signals are transmitted using the LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) technology through the CN-2153 board (MKE-8020A) or CN-2585 board (MKE-8021A), are decoded by the LVDS receivers (IC1901, 1902, 2001, 2002), and are then input to a TBC corresponding to each channel. After the clock switchover processing, the signals are output from the LVDS transmitters (IC2201 to 2203, IC2301 to 2303) to the DVP-30A board corresponding to each channel. Signals from the DVP-30A board are received by the LVDS receivers (IC2401 to 2403, IC2501 to 2503), and are then transferred to the VMIX where 4-channel composite processing and recursive effect processing using the SDRAM (IC3201, 3202) are added. A wire frame written in the ZBT SRAM (IC3102, 3104) by the sub CPU is added to the video signal as graphics. Each channel data is processed for output to the CN-2153 board (MKE-8020A) or CN-2585 board (MKE-8021A), and is then output from the LVDS transmitters (IC2901, 2902, 3001, 3002) through the TBC. The VIF-32 board generates power voltages 3.3 V, 2.5 V, and 1.5 V from the 12 V supplied by the MB-1049 board. The 3.3 V is mainly used for signal input/output processing, the 2.5 V for the DDR-SDRAM and monitor output, and the 1.5 V for the FPGA�fs internal logic. [2] MKE-8021A (Input/Output Board) 1. CN-2585 Board / IF-962 Board MKE-8021A consists of the CN-2585 board and the IF-962 board. The CN-2585 and IF-962 boards have HD/SD SDI interface with MVE-8000A and a monitor- out function. These boards receive control and configuration from the VIF-32 board. The video signals are transmitted/received to/from the VIF-32 board using the LVDS technology. Input processing V1 to V4, K1 to K4: The video signals input through the HD/SD SDI interface are converted to LVDS signals in the FPGAs (IC1, IC2), and are then sent to the VIF-32 board. Output processing V1 to 4, K1 to 4: The LVDS video signals sent from the VIF-32 board are serialized by the FPGAs (IC1, IC2), and are then output as HD/SD SDI signals. MONI1 to 4: The LVDS video signals sent from the VIF-32 board are transferred to the channel link deserializers (IC1101, IC1102), are serialized by the FPGAs (IC1, IC2), and are then output as HD/SD SDI signals. [3] MKE-8040A (Advanced Effects Board) 1. DVP-30A Board The DVP-30A board consists of a control block and a signal processing block. The control block consists of the sub CPU A (CPU-DR or CPU-DT) and the sub CPU B (CPU- DR or CPU-DT). Each sub CPU receives commands from the main CPU (CA-54CFC board) through the Dual Port RAM (IC1101, 1201) to control the signal processing block through the boot PLD (IC108). The FPGAs of both sub CPUs are controlled through the FPGA IF (IC107). Whether to choose sub CPU A or sub CPU B to perform the processing depends on the type of effect. These sub CPUs start up by booting the flash memory in the module, and then run the applications upon the second boot of the booting flash memory (IC1301, 1302) on this board. The boot PLD performs configuration of the other FPGAs on this board using the address decoding to the peripheral devices of the sub CPUs and the configuration data stored in the configuration flash memory (IC1303, 1304) under the control of the sub CPU A. Configuration data and applications to be stored in the flash memory are refreshed during the installation performed by the compact flash card of the main CPU. The signal processing block comprises five FPGAs: Pre Video Modify (PVM), Filter (FILTER), Address Generator (ADRS), Interpolator (INTP), and Mixer (MIX). The short names in parentheses ( ) are used in the description below. The respective FPGAs have the following main functions. (1) PVM (IC1) · Border/crop/beveled edge · Video modify (posterization, solarization, mosaic, etc.) · Input freeze · Mask key generation (2) FILTER (IC2) · Antialias filter (horizontal/vertical directions) · Scan conversion · Field/frame conversion · Defocus/blur · Through image processing for mask (3) ADRS (IC3) · 3D linear transform · Non-linear processing (4) INTP (IC4) · Interpolation · Lighting (5) MIX (IC5) · Recursive processing (single channel) The signal flows are as follows: The video and key signals of the main signal line are transmitted using the LVDS technology from the VIF-32 board to the LVDS receivers (IC1901 to 1903), and are then sent to PVM. In PVM, the video/key signals receive input freeze, video modify, and border/crop/beveled edge processing using the DDR SDRAM (IC2301, 2302), and are then transferred to FILTER. In FILTER, the signals receive filtering (antialias filter) in accordance with the defocus/blur in the horizontal direction first and with the reduction ratio. Then the signals receive re-arrangement (scan conversion) using the DDR SDRAM (IC2401, 2402), and also receive defocus/blur in the vertical direction and antialias filtering. The signals further receive Field/Frame Conversion using the DDR SDRAM (IC2501, 2502). The output data is sent to INTP to be stored in the ZBT SRAM. In ADRS, addresses for 3D linear transform and non-linear addresses are generated and transferred to INTP. In INTP, data is read from the ZBT SRAM at the address determined by ADRS, and the internal insertion processing is performed. The video and key signals to which interpolation processing has been applied are sent to MIX for lighting mixture using the light key generated by INTP. In MIX, recursive processing using the DDR SDRAM (IC3401, 3402) is performed for the video/key signals for programs to be transmitted to the VIF-32 board from the LVDS transmitters (IC2201 to 2203) using the LVDS technology.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
