It receives tally inputs from devices like switchers, record systems, etc. and provides this information over Ethernet to MAGNUM–TALLY to be processed. The tally information can then be used by MAGNUM–TALLY to provide tally information to Cameras, Under Monitor Displays (UMDs), Switchers, Replay and Record systems, or physical GPO’s for third party devices back to the 7800TR–32x24. Speciﬁ cations Rear 62pin D–Sub Connectors: 62pin D–Sub: Each of the 2 D connectors have 16 GPO and 12 GPI along with Vcc WET and Gnd WET pins Control: Ethernet: RJ–45, standard gigabit Ethernet interface Electrical: Supply: Auto Ranging 100–240V, 50/60Hz Consumption: 10W (typical) or 50W (max, wet power being used) Redundant PSU: Optional Wet Vcc: 5V or 12V Physical (number of slots) : 7700FR–C: 2 7800FR: 2 7801FR: 1 7800TR–32X24 Modular Tally Router Rear Plate Sufﬁ x +3RU 3RU Rear Plate for use with 7700FR–C or 7800FR Multiframe Enclosures 350FR 3RU Portable Multiframe which holds up to 7 single slot modules 7800FR 3RU Multiframe which holds up to 15 single slot modules 7801FR 1RU Multiframe which holds up to 4 single or 2 dual slot module Ordering Information 7700TPI PGM OUT 7700PTX-MVS 777777777777777700000000000000000TTTTTTTTTPPPIII7800TR-32x24 Xlink Discrete GPI / GPO 24 GPI Per 32 GPO Per Sources PVW OUT EQX TR4800E (+BP16) 32 GPI Per 48 16 IO GPO Per VIPX Multiviewer 7800TR–32x24 Modular Tally Router","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
