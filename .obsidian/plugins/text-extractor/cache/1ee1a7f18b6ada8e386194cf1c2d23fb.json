VIF-32 BoardThe VIF-32 board equipped with video input/output processing and video effect functions consists of a control block and a signal processing block.In the control block, the sub CPU (CPU-DR or CPU-DT) receives commands from the main CPU (on the CA-54CFC board) through the Dual Port RAM (IC1101) to control the signal processing block through the FPGA IF (IC603). The sub CPU starts up by booting the flash memory in the module, and then runs the applications upon the second boot of the flash RAM (IC1201) on this board.The boot PLD (IC601) performs configuration of the signal processing block FPGA and the FPGA on the IF-962 board (MKE-8021A), using the address decoding to the peripheral devices of the sub CPU and the configuration flash memory (IC1202) data.Configuration data and applications to be stored in the flash memory are rewritten at every startup when the corresponding data in the compact flash card of the main CPU has been updated.The signal processing block processes 4-channel data of video/key signals in parallel.The five FPGAs perform input/output processing (TBC1 to 4) such as switchover from the external clock, recursive effect, 4-channel composite processing, and graphics display (VMIX) such as wire frame.The signal flows are as follows:Video/key input signals are transmitted using the LVDS (Low-Voltage Differential Signaling) technology through the CN-2153 board (MKE-8020A) or CN-2585 board (MKE-8021A), are decoded by the LVDS receivers (IC1901, 1902, 2001, 2002), and are then input to a TBC corresponding to each channel. After the clock switchover processing, the signals are output from the LVDS transmitters (IC2201 to 2203, IC2301 to 2303) to the DVP-30A board corresponding to each channel.Signals from the DVP-30A board are received by the LVDS receivers (IC2401 to 2403, IC2501 to 2503), and are then transferred to the VMIX where 4-channel composite processing and recursive effect processing using the SDRAM (IC3201, 3202) are added. A wire frame written in the ZBT SRAM (IC3102, 3104) by the sub CPU is added to the video signal as graphics.Each channel data is processed for output to the CN-2153 board (MKE-8020A) or CN-2585 board (MKE-8021A), and is then output from the LVDS transmitters (IC2901, 2902, 3001, 3002) through the TBC.The VIF-32 board generates power voltages 3.3 V, 2.5 V, and 1.5 V from the 12 V supplied by the MB-1049 board. The 3.3 V is mainly used for signal input/output processing, the 2.5 V for the DDR-SDRAM and monitor output, and the 1.5 V for the FPGAï¿½fs internal logic.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
