GTP/DC CONFIGURATION 1. On your GTP/DC navigate to the EVENT DEFINITIONS Page and select the “User Register Configuration” link. 2. Find the User register you dragged into your list and configure the dropdown for “One-Time Shot”. See my example below: 3. Navigate to the Event Monitoring Table and assign your Secondary Event User register to the necessary action. In my example below I have my Secondary Event User Register turning on a GPO: 4. When the Secondary Event triggers on the SPS-4200 playlist it will fire the GPO action assigned to it in the Event monitoring table. Page 2 of 5 Playlist Configuration 1. Open up the “dnf_config.txt” file and confirm that IP_9 is set to the IP address of the DC20 that will receive the Secondary Event. See my example below: 2.

For example if the “Sched Time” column for your Secondary Event is set to all zero’s the Secondary Event will always trigger at the beginning of the previous element. An example use of this would be to start a recording via a secondary event before clip playout. If you require the Secondary Event to trigger at the end of the previous element you will need to match the “Sched Time” column time with the duration time of the previous element. This will cause the necessary offset that will trigger the Secondary Event at the end of the previous element. An example use of this would be to switch a router/switcher at the end of a playlist via a secondary event. Alternatively the Sched Time column can be offset to trigger a secondary event while the previous element is in the middle of playing out a clip. An example use of this would be to trigger a bug/crawl during clip playout via the secondary event. Page 5 of 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
