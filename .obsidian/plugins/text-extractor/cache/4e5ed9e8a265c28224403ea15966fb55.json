These should be more stable than the Ajas but in the event they need to be restarted, this can be done via a power switch on the back panel. They are also accessible through a web browser where you can see various settings, the device password is dzw123. You can check Sync in Output properties for each SDI output and toggle Genlock Source if necessary. For some reason Genlock Status never shows as â€œSyncâ€ on output 1, only outputs 2-4. Seems like a bug. Note: There is a â€œReset Deviceâ€ button under Device Properties. This will not just do a restart, it will wipe it back to defaults. You need to enter the password to do it, but just in case. They are in use for 3A Curved Wall Backup. The primary is still using the Ajas located in Rack 14.
