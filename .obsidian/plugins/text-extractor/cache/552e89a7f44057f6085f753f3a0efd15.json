The differences in shapes, functions, and operations among models are clarified with the model names in the text or the following model-distinction labels: [1500] Text or figures applicable to the HDLA1500 [1505] Text or figures applicable to the HDLA1505 [1507] Text or figures applicable to the HDLA1507 Text and figures for which there is no such labels apply in common to all three models. Overview The HDLA1500-series adaptors are designed to enable mounting a large lens for studio use and/or a large viewfinder to an HDC1500/1550/1400/3300 HD Color Camera (portable camera). The HDLA1500/1505 Large Lens Adaptor, in combination with a viewfinder among various types, allows the camera to be fitted with a large lens of high magnification, yielding high-speed controlability for system camera operations in studios or on relay mobiles. The HDLA1507 Large Viewfinder Adaptor accepts a portable camera on which a lens has been mounted so that it can be used in combination with a large viewfinder. Principal Differences Among the Models The mountable lens and viewfinder depends on the model. Features Compatible with large lenses of Sony specifications [1500][1505] The adaptor allows you to attach Sony hanger-type large lenses. It is compatible with both full servo-controlled and manually controlled lenses. Instant Docking Mechanism The camera can be mounted with no cable connections and no adjustments. Signal, power and control interface between the camera and the adaptor are achieved via a special connector located on the bottom of the camera HDLA1500 HDLA1505 HDLA1507 Large lens for studio use Can be attached to the lens mount on the front panel Can be attached to the lens mount on the front panel _ Portable lens __ Can be used mounted on the camera as-is Large type (e.g. HDVF-700A, HDVF-9900) Can be mounted on the table of the rear upper block _ Can be mounted on the table of the rear upper block Small type (e.g. HDVF-C730W, HDVF-C950W) _ Can be used mounted on the camera as-is _LensViewfinder 29Overview without the need for any cable. The special mechanism that requires no adjustment is employed also for connection of a lens. Independent lens attachment/detachment To make transportation and storage easy, you can attach/ detach the lens only, leaving the camera mounted in the adaptor. Compatible with large viewfinders [1500][1507] The HDVF-700A (7-inch monochrome) or HDVF-9900 (9-inch color) can be attached to the viewfinder table. With the mechanism to slide the position of the viewfinder forward and back, the portable camera in the adaptor can have the same total longitudinal size as that of the HDC1000, a large camera for studio use, permitting you to readily use the portable camera as if it were a studio-use camera. Control panel of the studio-use camera type The control panel on the rear panel provides functions equivalent to those of the HDC1000 video camera for studio use. It allows you to operate the portable camera in this adaptor as you would a studio camera. System Configuration Peripherals and related devices for the HDLA1500 series are shown in the figures. Production of some of the peripherals and related devices shown in the figures has been discontinued.
