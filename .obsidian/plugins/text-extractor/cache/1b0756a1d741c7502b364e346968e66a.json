GENLOCK DreamCatcher currently requires a Black Burst reference signal. Plug the reference signal into DIN 1 at the back of DreamCatcher as shown on Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-9.To check the reference standard follow the setup in section 3.3.1 and section 3.4.2.1 to get to DreamCatcher‟s Configuration page. Once on the page you should see reference detected as NTSC or PAL. 2.8. INPUT/OUTPUTS DreamCatcher‟s Inputs and Outputs can be dynamically configured using the web configuration application. For this reason the labelling on the back of DreamCatcher may not be accurate. Using Figure 2-1, follow these general rules for cabling inputs and outputs.  Input connection will be connected to the DIN immediately following the last output. In Figure 2-9 this would be the second DIN from the bottom.  The remaining outputs will connect incrementally following output 1.  The first input connection will be connected to the DIN immediately following the last output. DreamCatcher Replay System Installation Guide Page 12 Revision 1.4  Use Figure 2-9 and Table 2-1, Table 2-2 and Table 2-3 below for all possible Input/Output configurations.

INPUT/OUTPUTS FOR HIGH DENSITY SYSTEM A second karak card can be added to DreamCatcher‟s Inputs and Outputs. It can be dynamically configured using the web configuration application. For this reason the labelling on the back of DreamCatcher may not be accurate. With a high density system you have 2 sets of DIN connections. The left side represents the inputs and right side represents the outputs. The reference DIN connections DreamCatcher Replay System Installation Guide Page 14 Revision 1.4 remain the bottom two DIN. The most that can be done are 10in x 4out in a HD setup, and 8in x 2out on 1080P setup, Using 2-4, follow these general rules for cabling inputs and outputs.  Connect output 1 to the DIN connector immediately adjacent to the reference signal connector.
