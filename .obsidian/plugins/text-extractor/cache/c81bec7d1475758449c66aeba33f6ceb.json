It performs signal processing, provides an interface for external equipment, and supplies power to the camera. The CCU can be combined with an RCP-1000-series Remote Control Panel (optional) to form a camera control system. Features The HXCU-D70 can be connected with a single multi-core cable A camera control system with the HXC-D70 high resolution HD color camera can be built up using just one Sony-standard multi-core cable (CCZ-A). Easy-to-use control panel The HXCU-D70 has a fully-functional, ergonomically- designed front panel that includes basic adjustment of the monitor image. Multi-system input/output interface The HXCU-D70 includes the following input and output signal connectors to manage various system setups. Video outputs • SDI (main), 2-system (HD/SD selectable, embedded audio) • SDI (monitor), 2-system (HD/SD selectable, embedded audio, superimposed character and marker display) • HDMI1), 1-system (monitor) • Analog composite (VBS 2-system, PIX 1-system) • Analog component, 1-system (HD Y/Pb/Pr, HD R/G/B, SD Y/R-Y/B-Y, SD R/G/B 4-format selectable) • S-VIDEO, 1-system • Sync, 1-system (HD/SD selectable) 1) HDMI, the HDMI logo and High-Definition Multimedia Interface are trademarks or registered trademarks of HDMI Licensing, LLC.

Changing Menu Item Settings The menu screen is controlled using the knob and levers in the MENU control block on the front panel. Setting the CANCEL/ENTER lever to the ENTER position and pressing the CONTROL knob perform the same function. To display a menu page Set the DISP/MENU lever to the MENU position. When first powered on, the CCU MENU page is displayed. To display the CCU MENU page In menu display mode, turn the CONTROL knob to move the pointer (,) to TOP in the upper right corner of the menu page, then press the CONTROL knob. The CCU MENU showing the menu configuration is displayed. To select an item in the CCU MENU Turn the CONTROL knob to move the pointer (,) up/down to the desired menu item, then press the CONTROL knob. The most recently viewed page in the selected menu is displayed. To change the displayed page 1 Turn the CONTROL knob to move the pointer (,) to the page number, then press the CONTROL knob. The pointer (,) changes to a flashing question mark (?). 2 Turn the CONTROL knob to change the displayed page to the desired page, then press the CONTROL knob. The question mark (?) changes back to the pointer (,). Items on the page can now be selected and changed. To change a menu item setting If a question mark (?) is displayed beside the page number, press the CONTROL knob to restore the pointer (,). Items on the page can now be selected and changed. 1 Turn the CONTROL knob to move the pointer (,) to the desired item, then press the CONTROL knob. The pointer (,) changes to a flashing question mark (?). 2 Turn the CONTROL knob to change the setting. To cancel a changed setting Set the CANCEL/ENTER lever to the CANCEL position before pressing the CONTROL knob. The item is restored to its current setting. To suspend menu changes Set the DISP/MENU lever to the MENU position to exit the menu screen. The DISP/MENU lever can be set to the MENU position again to restart the operation. 3 Press the CONTROL knob. The question mark (?) changes back to the pointer (,), and the item setting is registered. 4 Repeat steps 1 to 3 to change other settings on the same page.

Moving the pointer (,) to an item with a character string input and pressing the CONTROL knob displays a rectangular cursor and a list of selectable characters. Turning the CONTROL knob moves the cursor between characters. The following menu item has character strings: • CCU CONFIGURATION menu → <BAR CHARACTER> page → BAR CHARACTER 1 Move the text cursor to the input position, then press the CONTROL knob. A second cursor is displayed in the character list. 2 Turn the CONTROL knob to move the cursor to the desired character, then press the CONTROL knob. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to enter other characters. • Select INS to insert a space character at the cursor position. • Select DEL to delete the character at the cursor position. • Select RET to return to step 1 without changing the string. • Entering the maximum number of characters (up to the right edge) moves the cursor to ESC on the lower right of the character list. 3 Turn the CONTROL knob to move the cursor to END, then press the CONTROL knob. The new input string is registered. To cancel the character string setting Turn the CONTROL knob to move the cursor to ESC, then press the CONTROL knob. To exit the menu display In menu display mode, set the DISP/MENU lever to the MENU position. 18 Setup Menu Menu Tree SYSTEM OPERATION menu CCU CONFIGURATION menu OUTPUT SELECT OUTPUT PIX GENLOCK PHASE REFERENCE GENLOCK H STEP COARSE SC PHASE V PHASE SYNC OUT MULTI FORMAT FREQUENCY CAMERA FORMAT OUTPUT FORMAT SLOT NO 1- 1&2 3&4 HDMI COMPONENT SD ASPECT SD ASPECT SD LB SEL H POSITION CENTER V POSITION CENTER H INTERP V INTERP COLOR BAR HD BAR SEL MF CB SLOPE SD BAR BAR CHARA GRAY BAR CHARACTER BAR CHARACATER ALL CLEAR MONITOR 1 CHARACTER WHITE LEVEL BLACK LEVEL PIX CHARACTER WHITE LEVEL BLACK LEVEL MONITOR 2 LEVEL GATE Y LEVEL1 Y LEVEL2 GATE MARKER MODULATION MARKER MIC/AUDIO CAM MIC GAIN CH1 CH2 AUDIO OUTPUT CH1 LEVEL CH2 LEVEL INTERCOM SYSTEM I/F TERMINATION FRONT INCOM INCOM MIC MIC TYPE MIC GAIN SIDE TONE PGM MIX PGM LEVEL VIDEO SETUP SETUP Q FILTER SD G/Y SYNC VIDEO ADJUST VBS LEVEL CHROMA PIX LEVEL CHROMA S-VIDEO LEVEL COMPONENT LEVEL MENU SETTINGS RESUME RE DIRECTION CATEGORY PAGE ITEM DATA PGM INPUT 19Setup Menu NETWORK SETTINGS menu DISPLAY MESSAGE ALARM JUMP MASTER GAIN ECS/SHUTTER ND FILTER IRIS EXTENDER DATE DATE/TIME TIME ZONE OTHERS REAR PREVIEW CABLE COMP FRONT PANEL 1 ASSIGNABLE/CUSTOM SW1 SW2 VOLUME VOLUME MODE IRIS M BLACK R/B BLACK R/B WHITE FRONT PANEL 2 VOLUME REL COEFF IRIS M BLACK R/B BLACK R/B WHITE CUSTOM SW BRIGHT FRONT PANEL 3 LOCK TARGET TCP/IP SETTING IP ADDRESS SUBNET MASK DEFAULT GATEWAY SET LAN SETTINGS AUTO NEGOTIATION CONNECTION SPEED DUPLEX MODE LINK CONDITION SET CNS SETTINGS CNS MODE CCU NO NETWORK RESET ALL RESET 20 Setup Menu Menu List The following conventions are used in the menu list table.

Note that in summer the temperature in a car with the windows closed can reach 50 °C (122 °F). • Very damp or dusty places. • Where rain is likely to reach the unit. • Places subject to severe vibration. • Near strong magnetic fields. • Near transmitting stations generating strong radio waves. Avoid violent impacts Dropping the unit, or otherwise imparting a violent shock to it, is likely to cause it to malfunction. Do not cover with cloth While the unit is in operation, do not cover it with a cloth or other material. This can cause the temperature to rise, leading to a malfunction. After use Set the POWER switch on the CCU to the OFF position. Care If the body or panels of the unit become dirty, wipe them with a dry cloth. For severe dirt, use a soft cloth steeped in a small amount of neutral detergent, then wipe dry. Do not use volatile solvents such as alcohol or thinners, as these may damage the finish. Low-loss Digital Transmission via Multi-core Cable Digital data transmission between the camera and CCU minimizes image degradation regardless of transmission distance. However, some errors, for example errors due to external noise in long-distance transmission, may be corrected by partial image interpolation of images in frame store. Multi-core transmission distances The transmission distance allowed for Sony CCZ-A multi-core cable1) connections is between 5 m and 100 m 2). The distance may decrease depending on the conditions, such as cable degradation. 1) CCZ-A5/10/25/50/100 cable 2) Based on a single CCZ-A100 cable used. Transmission range may vary when more than one cable is used. Notes on using cable extension connectors (CCZZ-1E, CCZZ-1B): Avoid using more than three connectors at the same time. Transmission range may decrease by 10 m when one cable connector is used. Examples of cable connection An equivalent cable length of up to 100 m is approved. With a length of more than 100 m, losses in the cable will not be compensated properly. Error Messages When an error is detected in the CCU or the camera, the ALARM indicator turns on and an error message is displayed on the CCU.
