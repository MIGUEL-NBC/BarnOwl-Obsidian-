iAM-MIX Page 6 CHAPTER 1: Installation Introduction Overview The iAM-MIX intelligent adaptable monitors are 1RU multichannel multi-source audio monitors with multiple standard copper connections and multiple SFP module options facilitating high density coax and optical fiber connections. They feature direct integration capability with Evertz, Tally, and Grass Valley routers for channel name synchronization. The iAM-MIX may also accept Audio over IP signals via an Ethernet connector. Refer to the Specifications section or contact Wohler Sales for more information for Audio over IP capabilities. The iAM-MIX may be optionally configured to allow routing of any inputs to almost any outputs. The iAM-MIX has individual channel volume controls and mute switches. With certain exceptions related to master clock compatibility, any channel from any source stream may be audibly monitored and mixed with the other selected channels. The iAM-MIX is small, flexible, moderately priced, and simple to operate. Setup configurations can easily be copied to other iAM-MIX units using a flash drive or by making use of a network connection. Setups are created with a web browser over a network connection. Each iAM-MIX can be configured with up to 64 Presets. Nothing about the configurations of those predefined setups can be changed from the front panel. This prevents less experienced or hurried operators from making accidental setup changes that could compromise their usage of the unit. It also reduces operator training to a minimum. Safety Instructions 1. Read, keep, and follow all of these instructions; heed all warnings. 2. Do not use this equipment near water. 3. Use only a dry cloth to clean the equipment. 4. Do not block any ventilation openings. 5. Do not install near any heat source such as a radiator, heat register, amplifier, or stove. 6. Do not attempt to plug the unit into a two-blade outlet (with only two prongs of equal width). Important: By design, this monitor will only plug into a three-prong outlet for your safety. If the plug does not fit into the outlet, contact an electrician to replace the obsolete outlet. iAM-MIX Page 7 7. Protect the power cord from being walked on or pinched, particularly at plug connection source on the equipment and at the socket. 8. Use only the attachments/accessories specified by the manufacturer. 9. Unplug the equipment during lightning storms or when unused for long periods of time. 10. Refer all servicing to qualified service personnel. Servicing will be required under all of the following conditions: a. The equipment has been damaged in any way, such as when the power- supply cord or plug is damaged. b. Liquid had been spilled or objects have fallen onto the equipment. c. The equipment has been exposed to rain or moisture. d. The equipment does not operate normally. e. The equipment has been dropped. Safety Symbols Mounting The unit is designed for a standard 19\" rack. Install it at ear/eye level for best high frequency response and visual observation of the display screens. Please adhere to the following clearances: Table 1-1: Clearance Recommendations Clearance Surface 24” Front 3” Rear 2” Sides 1.75” Top and Bottom (if either radiates heat) 0” Top and Bottom (if no heat) Heat Dissipation The ambient temperature inside the mounting enclosure should not exceed 40° Celsius (104° Fahrenheit). Adjacent devices can be rack mounted (or stacked) in proximity to the unit if this temperature is not exceeded. Otherwise, allow a 1RU (1.75”/44.45mm) space above and below the unit for air circulation. WARNING: The symbol to the left warns of electric shock hazard inside the unit. Disconnect the power cord before removing access panels when installing upgrades. Only qualified service personnel are to operate the equipment with covers removed, and are to exercise caution to avoid personal injury. iAM-MIX Page 8 Sympathetic Vibration Sympathetic vibration from other equipment (cables, etc.) in the rack may be serious enough to interfere with the unit’s sound quality. If you experience sympathetic vibrations, use thin card stock, felt, foam, or weather-stripping between the vibrating surfaces. Tie loose cables securely with cable ties. Mechanical Bracing The 1RU chassis is securely attached to the front panel. In addition, the chassis has mounting tabs through which you attach it to the rack rail. This feature will reduce or eliminate rear bracing requirements in many mobile/portable applications. The weight of internal components is distributed fairly evenly around the unit. Electrical Interference Be careful to avoid mismatched cable types and other similar causes of undesired reflections in digital signal systems. If severe enough, such reflections can result in corruption of the digital data stream. As with any audio equipment, maximum immunity from electrical interference requires the use of shielded cable; however, satisfactory results can sometimes be obtained without it. The internal circuitry ground is connected to the chassis. Power The unit comes with a standard 18 VDC / 3.9 A external power supply that connects to an AC mains power source (100 to 240 VAC, 1.5A, 50/60Hz) using an IEC power cord. When the mains plug or appliance coupler is used as the disconnect device, the disconnect device should remain operable. Important : Heat generated by the class D power amplifiers, power supplies, and other components is vented by slots in the sides and back of the unit. Therefore, as a safety precaution, you must allow proper ventilation on these surfaces. iAM-MIX Page 9 Compliance FCC This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class A digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference when the equipment is operated in a commercial environment. This equipment generates, uses, and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instruction manual, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. Operation of this equipment in a residential area is likely to cause harmful interference, in which case the user will be required to correct the interference at their own expense. ICES-003 This Class A digital apparatus complies with Canadian ICES-003. Cet appareil numérique de la classe A est conforme à la norme NMB-003 du Canada. iAM-MIX Page 10 CHAPTER 2: Local Operation Startup The iAM-MIX-8 and iAM-MIX-16 units (and their variants) take about a minute to become operational after power is applied. During that time, several status messages are shown spanning the displays on the front panel. Front Panel The iAM-MIX-8 front panel is shown in Figure 2-1. The iAM-MIX-16 front panel is shown in Figure 2-2. Figure 2–1: iAM-MIX-8 Front Panel iAM-MIX Page 11 1. Speakers: Audio monitoring is achieved through the use of class D amplifiers driving two (left/right) wide range speakers. 2. Headphone Jack: A 1/4\" jack for an optional headphone is provided on the front panel. Speaker audio mutes when headphones are plugged in. 3. Channel Volume/Mute: Rotating each Channel Volume/Mute control adjusts the individual level of each corresponding channel. Pressing this control knob alternately mutes or unmutes the associated channel. Holding the control knob pressed for two seconds solos the associated channel and mutes all others. 4. Master Volume: This control adjusts the level of the entire mix. Note that while there is a dedicated Master Volume control on the iAM-MIX-8, the iAM-MIX-16 incorporates a control that can be set up to be either a Master Volume control or a 16th Channel Volume/Mute control. When the control is optioned to be a Master Volume, it control the volume of all of the channels, including channel 16. Pressing a Master Volume control alternately mutes or unmutes the entire mix. 5. Control Strips and Level Meters: These miniature displays identify each Channel Volume/Mute control and provide a basic 10-segment level meter for each channel. The displays will automatically dim if the none of the front panel controls have been used for an hour, but will brighten again when any control is adjusted. Refer to the Channel Displays section of this chapter for further information on the functions of the Control Strips and Level Meters. 6. Preset/Config Button: Pressing this button activates a menu for Preset selection and configuration status information. Refer to the Preset/Config Menu section of this chapter for a description of how to use this button. 7. USB: This USB 2.0 Type A connector allows you to use a flash drive (not supplied) to perform software updates or copy system configurations to another iAM-MIX or to a PC. 8. Power Indicator: The Power indicator lights blue whenever the iAM-MIX is connected to power. iAM-MIX Page 12 Rear Panel The iAM-MIX-8 and iAM-MIX-16 rear panels are shown in Figure 2-3. They are identical. Some variants may not contain all options (e.g. the MADI only unit). Figure 2-3: Rear Panel Layout iAM-MIX Page 13 are automatically connected together to allow the MADI signal to pass through. 6. MADI Fiber SFP: (optional) This input module accepts an optical AES10 64-channel MADI input signal at 48 kHz sample rate. The SFP fiber module may be used in conjunction with the MADI BNC connectors to provide COAX to fiber or fiber to COAX conversion. The outputs are reclocked. A software license must be installed for the SFP port to function. Refer to the System Setup section in Chapter 4 and to Figure 4-8 to install software licenses. 7. Dolby Metadata: This output is not implemented at this time. 8. AES Out: By default, the BNC AES-1 jack outputs the same mixed audio as the XLR analog outputs, as heard from speakers or headphones, but as an AES3id pair. Other options may be set in the iAM-MIX Web GUI. AES 2-4 jacks may be used with Common Output Routing, a licensable feature described in Chapter 4. 9. AES In: These four BNC jacks accept AES3id digital audio pairs at 48 kHz sample rate. Channels are selected as AES 1-8. 10. SFP Module Cages: The two SFP cages are provided to accept one or two optional SFP modules compatible with SDI coaxial or optical signals. Single or dual transceiver arrangements are possible. The SFP modules are swappable for convenience. The iAM-MIX must be powered off while inserting an SPF module or else it must be power cycled after insertion. An optional license key must be purchased to enable each module. A software license must be installed for an SFP port to function. Refer to the System Setup section in Chapter 4 and to Figure 4-8 to install software licenses.

If the default configuration of the iAM-MIX suits your needs and you prefer to use it that way, then you do not need to use the iAM-MIX Web GUI. Web Browser / Control Device Any web browser application running on any networked device such as desktop or laptop computer, tablet or smart phone can be used with the iAM-MIX Web GUI. Tablets would need to be linked to a copper LAN through a Wi-Fi adapter if the tablet has no network connector. Phones are not recommended due to their smaller screen size that will require more scrolling. The Chrome ® web browser is recommended for speed and compatibility. First Time- IP Assignments The iAM-MIX can operate with a static (fixed) or dynamic (DHCP) IPv4 address. The address will be 172.27.2.2 when received from the factory or when switched from DHCP to static addressing mode. There are two basic types of connections that may be used to connect the iAM-MIX to a web browser, a Peer-to-Peer Connection or a Network Connection. Peer-to-Peer Connection The most straightforward way to connect the iAM-MIX to a web browser, free of possible network conflicts, is to establish a static peer-to-peer connection between the setup computer and the iAM-MIX. A 10/100/1000 MHz Ethernet switch may be used in between, but is not required. Figure 4-1 shows an example of suitable address settings for the host computer in a Windows 7 control panel. iAM-MIX Page 25 Figure 4–1: Host IP Settings Close the control panel and reboot the host computer after making an IP address change to be sure the change takes effect. Either reconnect to the installed network or continue with this direct connection to access the iAM-MIX Web GUI. Network Connection When connected to a network, the iAM-MIX address will need to be changed to another address in order to be compatible with the address assignments for that particular network. Immediately after the host setup is complete, change the address of the iAM-MIX. Make the corresponding address, mask and gateway changes in the iAM-MIX Network Setup page. Refer to the Network Setup section of this chapter and Figure 4-11. Otherwise set the iAM-MIX to DHCP address mode by checking the box for ‘Use DHCP?’ in Network Setup and have your IT administrator assign rights and settings for operation on the network. Allow enough time for your network’s DHCP server to recognize a new network device and assign an address after booting. iAM-MIX Page 26 Dashboard Throughout the iAM-MIX Web GUI, other pages are a click or two away on the left side. The Dashboard/Presets Overview on the Dashboard page shows all Preset configurations at a glance. Figure 4–2: Dashboard/Presets Overview iAM-MIX Page 27 Sign In Only authorized users should be allowed to make Preset and network changes. Anybody can view the status of iAM-MIX units on the network, but logging in with a password is required to make any changes. When logging in is required to make a change, the page shown in Figure 4-3 will appear. Alternatively, login can be done at any time by clicking on Administrative Account selection in the upper right portion of the browser page and clicking Log In. Figure 4–3: Administrative Account Log In By default, the User Name is ‘admin’. By default, the Password is ‘admin’. To increase password security, refer to the System Setup | Password Setup section of this chapter and change the password. You will remain logged in until the browser window is closed, the session is disconnected physically or virtually, or you Log Out by clicking Administrator Account in the upper right of any page. Note: If you forget your password, you will have to perform a Factory Reset. Refer to the Factory Reset section of this chapter. iAM-MIX Page 28 Remote Monitoring Channels from the active Preset can be monitored remotely with this selection. The channel metering will appear as shown in Figure 4-4. Figure 4–4: Remote Monitor iAM-MIX Page 29 Configuration - Preset Setup Presets are monitoring configurations that can be composed of channels from multiple sources and displayed on the meters in any order. Presets should be set up to allow operators to quickly shift between setups for monitoring. Up to 64 Presets can be set. Any of these presets can be recalled from the Web Dashboard or from REST API's. Up to 8 Presets (in the iAM-MIX-8) or 16 Presets (in the iAM-MIX-16) can be denoted as Favorites to be displayed on the Preset Selection menu of the unit. The Configuration - Preset Setup screen contains selections of all of the details for a Preset, and is largely arranged in a matrix format connecting input channels to monitoring channels. The screen shown in Figure 4-5 contains settings for 8 meters as is contained in an iAM-MIX-8. The screen for iAM-MIX-16 would show settings for 16 meters. Figure 4–5: Configure Presets iAM-MIX Page 30 • To create a new Preset, enter the name for the new Preset in the field to the left of the word Preset. Click the Star icon to make it a Favorite, if desired. Then make all of the settings needed and save it. • To make changes to an existing Preset, select it from the pull down list, make the needed changes and save it. • To create a new Preset starting with an existing Preset, first select the existing Preset from the pull down list. Next, enter the name for the new Preset and save it. Then make the needed changes and save it. 2. System Clock Reference: There must be a system clock reference for monitoring to take place. Select a reference from the pull down list. The best choice is a stable, always present clock source locked to house sync. Second to that, use the selected input as the clock. Generally speaking, Internal is not the best choice. An SDI or MADI stream may exhibit some audible clicks if it is not synchronized externally and is not selected as the clock reference. A missing signal selected as the clock reference can prevent all audio from being monitored. It can also prevent the iAM-MIX integration with external routers from working. 3. Speaker Delay: If desired, an audio delay may be inserted ahead of the monitor speakers. This delay may range from 0 to 170 mS. Typically, delay is used to align the monitored audio with a video monitored signal. 4. Input Selection: Audio from any of the input sources may be applied to the monitoring scheme in any way. For example, you may have 6 channels from an SDI stream, along with 2 AES channels, and along with 2 analog channels assigned your choice of meters. A Preset Input/Output Matrix is provided on the lower right side of the screen to allow you to assign each channel. Simply select each input source, one at a time, and then check the boxes in the Matrix to apply each input channel number to a metered channel number. They do not have to be applied in any specific order. The order of assignment should be chosen to make it easy for the operator to understand. If there are more than 16 channels in a source, the desired group of 8 or 16 can also be selected from the box in the lower left of the screen. 5. Autofill Selection: If you simply want to map all 8 or 16 input channels to all 16 meters in the same order, click the Autofill button. The Preset Input/Output Matrix will automatically fill out. To remove all mapping, click the Reset button that is adjacent to the Autofill button. 6. Cluster Definition and Naming: Only one type of Channel Cluster is available in the iAM-MIX, a Mono 1.0 cluster. Clicking a Cluster Info box opens a Cluster selection box. iAM-MIX Page 31 Figure 4–6: Cluster Naming iAM-MIX Page 32 12. Channel Information: Hovering over each red/yellow/green Channel or Cluster Info box opens a summary of channel settings. You may use this to verify that you have correctly entered the needed channel settings. Refer to Figure 4-7. Figure 4–7: Channel Summary iAM-MIX Page 33 Common Output Routing The Common Output Routing licensed feature allows channels to be routed or combined and routed in custom ways to various destination outputs. Common Output routing is applied to: 1. Signals monitored using \"Input Source select\" from the Front Panel, 2. Presets that have been created to apply the COR. Any change to the COR will affect the Presets that have \"Apply COR\" selected. For example, multiple channels of an 7.1 channel program can be combined and directed to the left or right internal speakers. Six or eight channels could be directed to the AES outputs, which could feed an external surround sound system. Contact Wohler Sales to purchase the license for this feature. If Common Output Routing is not licensed, then any of the iAM-MIX inputs can be monitored in stereo or mono only through the internal speakers. The headphone jack, the analog XLR outputs, and the first AES output will follow whatever is directed to the speakers. When licensed, select Common Output Routing under Configuration. This will display the Common Output Routing (COR) screen. This screen contains a matrix which forms an easy way for you to set up the wide variety of input to output routing and mixing capabilities. The COR screen is shown in Figure 4-8. Figure 4–8: Common Output Routing (COR) Screen iAM-MIX Page 34 speakers. The default routing is set as per the Speaker Assignment, left channels are sent to the left speaker and right channels are sent to Right speaker. 2. Analog XLR: Selected inputs will be mixed to the left and right channels and played through the two Analog XLR Outputs. 3. AES/Pair-1: Selected inputs will be mixed to the left and right channels and played through the AES Pair 1 Output. 4. AES/Pair-2: Selected inputs will be mixed to the left and right channels and played through the AES Pair 2 Output. 5. AES/Pair-3: Selected inputs will be mixed to the left and right channels and played through the AES Pair 3 Output. 6. AES/Pair-4: Selected inputs will be mixed to the left and right channels and played through the AES Pair 4 Output. The four AES outputs can be used together to output, for example, 5.1 or 7.1 surround channels to an external surround sound monitor system. 7. AoIP/Pair-30 (DANTE / RAVENNA): Selected inputs will be mixed to AoIP transmit channels 59 and 60. Note that configuration for channels 1 - 58 is not supported. Use a Dante Controller or Coveloz web interface to route these channels appropriately. 8. AoIP/Pair-31 (DANTE / RAVENNA): Selected inputs will be mixed to Channel 61 and Channel 62. Again, use a Dante Controller or Coveloz web interface to route the remaining pairs appropriately. Routing Inputs The inputs which may be routed are described in this section. 1. Cluster Information: Cluster information show type of cluster and cluster name. iAmMix currently only supports Mono clusters. 2. Speaker Assignment : Speaker assignment can be used to configure to which speakers the audio is routed to. The possible options are: L Left R Right C Center LFE Low Frequency Effects Ls Left Surround Rs Right Surround Bsl Back Surround Left Bsr Back Surround Right S Mono Surround 3. Input Gain (dB): Settings from -60 dB to +12 dB in 1 dB increments to allow for differences in gain between speakers in a set. iAM-MIX Page 35 Output Options The optional settings in this section allow for customization. 1. Speaker Mix: This option selects whether an output has the Speaker Mix or a Free Mix as set in the Routing Input section. The Speaker/Headphone output is always in the Speaker Mix. 2. Solo/Mute: This setting determines whether or not the outputs are affected by solos and mutes. The Speaker/Headphone output is always affected by solos and mutes. Note also, that all outputs in Speaker Mix mode also are affected by solos and mutes. 3. Mute on Headphone Insertion: This option controls whether the outputs should be muted upon a headphone insertion. This setting can be adjusted even for outputs whether they are in Speaker Mix or Free Mix modes. 4. Master Volume Control: This setting determines whether each output pair is adjusted by the Master Volume Control knobs. Speaker/Headphone outputs are always affected by the volume control knob, as are any outputs that are in Speaker Mix mode. 5. Channel Volume Control: This setting determines whether each output pair is adjusted by the Channel Volume Control knobs. Speaker/Headphone outputs are always affected by the volume control knob, as are any outputs that are in Speaker Mix mode. 6. Output Trim: The gain of each output channel can be adjusted from -60 dB to +12 dB in 1 dB increments to allow for differences between speakers in a set. Output level trims are always available for each output, regardless of whether they are in Speaker Mix or Free Mix mode. iAM-MIX Page 36 Preset Output Routing For many applications, Common Output Routing will be used when the routings generally remain fixed for normal use of the monitor. However, sometimes it can be advantageous to be able to change the output routing according to the currently recalled Preset. In this case, licensed Preset Output Routing feature may be used. The Preset Output Routing tab, located in the Configuration - Preset section, can be used to set output routings individually for each Preset. The Preset Output Routing Screen is shown in Figure 4-9. Figure 4–9: Preset Output Routing Screen Note that all of the capabilities found in the Common Output Routing and described in the previous sections also apply for the Preset Output Routing. The Preset Output Routings are distinct from the Common Output Routing, however the Apply Common I/O Routing box may be checked to make them the same. Make sure this box is not checked if you prefer to devise a custom Preset Output Routing. iAM-MIX Page 37 Typical Questions Regarding Output Routing The questions and thoughts in this section are commonly asked by people when setting up the licensed Output Routing capability. How do I route sources being audibly monitored to the XLR and AES outputs? Using Preset Output Routing or Common Output Routing, signals can be routed to XLR and/or AES outputs, possibly to be monitored by external speakers. In Figure 4-10, signals displayed on meters 1 through 8 are routed pair wise to AES Pair 1 and signals displayed on meters 9 through 16 are routed pair wise to the Analog XLR outputs. Figure 4-10 - Output Routing to AES and Analog Outputs How do I output pre-fade signals on one output and post-fade outputs on another? For example, to output downmixed pre-fade audio signals on AES Pair-1, keep the associated Master and Channel Volume Controls OFF (unchecked). Or, to output post-fade audio signals on the Analog XLR, keep the associated Master and Channel Volume Controls ON (checked). Figure 4-11 shows both of these setups. Figure 4-11 - Output Routing of Pre-Fade and Post-Fade Audio iAM-MIX Page 38 How do I make some outputs follow Mutes and Solos while making other outputs ignore them? In the example shown in Figure 4-12, the Analog XLR Outputs will follow Solos and Mutes, while AES Pair 1 will ignore them. Simple check or uncheck the Solo/Mute selection in the Output Options section. Figure 4-12 - Applying Solos and Mutes to Output Routing How do I route only specific monitored channels to the Analog XLR outputs? Using Output Routing, certain selected channels may be routed to any chosen outputs. In Figure 4-13, channels monitored on meters 9 to 16 are combined and routed to the Analog XLR outputs. Figure 4-13 - Specific Channel Output Routing How do I configure outputs for Source Select options, without creating Presets? Use the Common Output Routing settings to determine how the outputs are configured for source select options. The Common Output Routing feature allows channels to be routed or combined and routed to various destinations. For example, channels 1 to 8 can be routed to AES outputs, channels 9 to 16 can be routed to Analog XLR outputs. Figure 4-14 shows the various outputs that channels can be routed to from selected sources. iAM-MIX Page 39 Figure 4-14 - Source Select Output Routing How do I keep the internal speakers always muted and send audio only to the Analog XLR outputs? You may monitor the audio using an external amplifiers and speakers instead of the internal speakers. In Output Routing Configuration, do not select any channel sources for speaker/headphone. Instead select the desired channels to be monitored by the Analog XLR Outputs. Figure 4-15 illustrates channels 1 - 6 being monitored by external amplifiers and speakers instead of the internal speakers. Figure 4-15 - Output Routing with Internal Speakers Muted iAM-MIX Page 40 How do I ensure that outputs get automatically muted when a headphone is inserted into the headphone jack? In Output Routing configuration, if the Mute on Headphone Insertion selection in the Output Options is ON (checked), then the outputs get automatically muted when a headphone jack is inserted into the headphone jack. In Figure 4-16, AES Pair 1 will be muted when a headphone is inserted, but the Analog XLR outputs will not. Figure 4-16 - Headphone Insertion Muting Effect on Output Routing Why are AES Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the Output Routing Matrix? If channels are to be monitored using a multichannel external sound system, then the multiple AES Outputs can be used to output 6 or 8 channels to it. Using the output routing matrix, check the channels to be monitored on each of the AES Outputs. This will route the audio channels to the AES Outputs on the rear panel. What are AoIP-Pair 30 and AoIP Pair 31? Figure 4-14 shows the AoIP Output channels in the Output Matrix. They perform the following functions: AoIP-Pair 30: Selected inputs will be mixed to AoIP transmit channels 59 and 60. Note that configuration for channels 1 - 58 is not supported. Use a Dante Controller or Coveloz web interface to route these channels appropriately. AoIP-Pair 31: Selected inputs will be mixed to Channel 61 and Channel 62. Again, use a Dante Controller or Coveloz web interface to route the remaining pairs appropriately. iAM-MIX Page 41 How do I route signals to the Analog XLR Outputs in a way that Master Volume doesn't affect this output but Channel Volume and Mute/Solo does? In Output Routing setting for the Analog XLR outputs, set the Master Volume Control to OFF (unchecked) but set the Channel Volume Control & Solo/Mute to ON (checked). This is illustrated in Figure 4-17. Figure 4-17 - Effect of Master Volume and Solo/Mute Settings on Outputs How do I make Channel Volume, but not Mutes or Solos, affect the output? In Output Routing setting, for the chosen output, set the Master Volume Control and Solo/Mute to OFF (unchecked) and set the Channel Volume Control to ON (checked). This is illustrated in Figure 4-18 for the Analog XLR outputs. Figure 4-18 - Effect of Channel Volume on Outputs iAM-MIX Page 42 Configuration – Device Management This page is used to manage integration with Grass Valley systems to automatically set the text in the labels on the channel strips. Grass Valley integration can be used for AES and SDI audio monitoring interfaces. Evertz and Tally integrations do not require any setup. They are used for the MADI audio monitoring interface. Figure 4–19: Device Management iAM-MIX Page 43 Configuration – Preset Management The Web GUI of the iAM-MIX makes it easy to manage multiple iAM-MIX units on a network from a single location. The Preset Management page is used to copy Presets from either this iAM-MIX or from a file on the host PC to one or more other iAM-MIX units on the network. Having the same Presets on multiple iAM-MIX units allows operators to move from unit to unit without having to deal with any setup differences in each unit. The Preset Management page is shown in Figure 4-20. Figure 4–20: Preset Management iAM-MIX Page 44 Copying Presets from this Unit After the list of iAM-MIX units on the network has appeared, the screen shown in Figure 4-21 will appear. Using this screen, you may select which of the units on the network should receive the copies of the Presets. Figure 4–21: Preset Management iAM-MIX Page 45 Copying Presets from Files After the list of iAM-MIX units on the network has appeared, the screen shown in Figure 4-22 will appear. Using this screen, you may select which of the units on the network should receive the copies of the Presets. Figure 4–22: Preset Management Target Status Target Selection Source Selection Apply PresetsFile Preset Version To copy the Presets from a file to other iAM-MIX units on the network, use the following steps: 1. Click Select File from the Source Selection buttons. 2. Enter a version name in the Preset Version field shown in Figure 4-22. 3. Use the Choose File button to select the file you would like to copy to other iAM-MIX units. 4. In the Target Selection column, check the box of each iAM-MIX to receive the Presets. 5. After selecting one or more units, click the Apply Presets to Selected Devices button. A confirmation box will pop up. Click Apply Presets in that box. 6. As the Preset copying proceeds, the Process and Status boxes will show the progress as follows: Process Status Copying files Validating file Loading Presets Finished Error copying presets iAM-MIX Page 46 Dirty Presets Whenever any changes on a Preset are done locally, the Preset is labeled as \"Dirty\". An example of this is shown in Figure 4-23. This means that this Preset is no longer exactly the same as it was when it was applied to that particular iAM-MIX. It is a reminder that if you are going to copy it to other units, you should be certain that it is the one you actually want to copy. Figure 4–23: Dirty Presets iAM-MIX Page 47 Database Management Export Presets Use this page to offload an iAM-MIX Preset database to a USB flash drive, inserted in the front panel port. Follow the instructions on the bottom of the page to complete the procedure. Figure 4–24: Export Presets iAM-MIX Page 48 Import Presets Use this page to retrieve Presets from a USB flash drive inserted in the front panel port.

The Preset data you selected will be copied into the iAM-MIX. Do not withdraw the Flash Drive before all of the data is copied. These instructions are summarized on the Database Management - Database Export / Import page. iAM-MIX Page 49 Scan Network-Discovery This page will scan the network for Wohler iAM monitors installed on the network. Other devices can have their network settings reconfigured by clicking the Edit (pencil) icon. Information about the Updates tab is in Installing Software on Networked iAM-MIXs. Figure 4–26: Active Device Discovery iAM-MIX Page 50 The procedure for changing the IP Address information is as follows: 1. Use DHCP? Check this box if your network has a DHCP server and you want to use dynamic addressing. Otherwise, you must enter static IP address entries in the four fields which follow. 2. IP Address: Enter the network address. Leading zeroes are not required. 3. IP Mask: This should usually be 255.255.255.0 unless your network can work across multiple subnets. 4. Gateway Address: This should usually be the same domain and subnet address numbers as the IP Address, but with the last octet being .1. 5. DNS-nameserver: A default value is shown for reference only. DNS is not normally required for basic static IP network configurations to work. Your IT administrator will specify a value to work with mixed static/dynamic network setups. Save: When you have made all of the necessary entries, press Save to apply the changes internally before rebooting the unit. System Setup The System Setup page provides access to product information, licensing information and entry, and AoIP card information. It actually consists of four screens, selected by the Product, Licenses, Password Setup, and AoIP Card tabs. Figure 4-28 shows the screen produced when the Product tab is clicked. Figure 4–28: System Setup - Product iAM-MIX Page 51 product. The OLED intensity control allows you to set the brightness of the front panel displays to suit the monitoring environment. There is also a System Logs button on this screen. This button can be used to save System Logs into a file. The information in this file could be very useful, should you need to contact Wohler Technical Service for any reason. Figure 4-29 shows the screen resulting from clicking the Licenses tab. Figure 4–29: System Setup - Licenses iAM-MIX Page 52 Figure 4-30 shows the screen resulting from clicking the Password Setup tab. Figure 4–30: System Setup – Password Setup iAM-MIX Page 53 Figure 4-31 shows the screen resulting from clicking the AoIP Card tab. Figure 4–31: System Setup - AoIP Card iAM-MIX Page 54 Cage Slots 1 and 2. This is particularly useful when setting up the SFP-2110 and SFP-2022-6 receiver card options, to check the network details. Factory Reset It can be useful to bring all of the settings of the iAM-MIX back to the way they were when it left the Wohler factory if the iAM-MIX is being reinstalled at a new location. This page is used to reset all of the settings in the iAM-MIX to their original. Figure 4–33: Factory Reset Factory Reset Selection iAM-MIX Page 55 Reboot System The Reboot System page allows you to reboot an iAM-MIX remotely. The Reboot System page is shown in Figure 4-34. This function is normally only used upon request from Wohler Technical Service to troubleshoot or correct an issue. The Reboot System function should be used with a bit of caution. It puts the iAM- MIX out of service for several minutes while it is rebooting, and this may unexpectedly interfere with the use of the product by the remote operator. Figure 4–34: Reboot System If you have any doubt as to whether you should reboot the remote iAM-MIX, do not click the Reboot System button. Contact Wohler Technical Service for advice. iAM-MIX Page 56 APPENDIX A: Software Upgrades Introduction This chapter describes how to download a software update file to your computer, transfer it to a USB flash drive and install the update into an iAM-MIX. Download the Software The iAM-MIX software update can be found at http://www.wohler.com, under Product Downloads on the Products > iAM-MIX page, in Support > Downloads > Drivers & Software, or contact Wohler Customer Support for more information. Unzip and copy the update file(s) from your computer to the root directory (not inside a folder) of a USB flash drive. It must be FAT32 file type, and does not need to be empty. Both local and network update methods require that a USB flash drive, with Wohler Update Package(s) installed on it, be inserted into the front panel USB jack. Installing the Software Locally Click on the System Update selection in the web browser GUI. The screen shown in Figure A-1 will appear. System Information in the right pane shows currently installed software and hardware versions. Important: The iAM-MIX Web GUI is required to perform the software upgrade procedure.

When the update is complete, each updated Target unit will restart and again be ready for use. 9. If you have also updated the unit to which the Web GUI is connected, after the iAM-MIX unit(s) reboot, either Refresh the browser by clicking on the Wohler logo, or close and reopen the browser for normal operation of the Web GUI. Important: Do not interrupt or remove power to any of the iAM-MIX units being updated, and do not remove the USB drive during the update process. Doing so could crash the iAM-MIX software. iAM-MIX Page 62 APPENDIX B: Dante Network Setup Introduction Installing the iAM-MIX into an existing and functioning Dante network is virtually plug and play. The iAM-MIX rear panel AoIP jack supports 1Gb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet devices in Dante Audio over IP network configurations. iAM-MIX channel source selections are made by choosing Input Type ‘AoIP’ in the Configuration-Configure Presets page regardless of which AoIP option is installed. The iAM-MIX is set up at the Wohler factory to be used as a slave rather than a master within the Dante network. Other devices or software, such as a Dante Controller, are expected to be responsible for most device configurations and all audio routing. Please refer to the Dante Controller User Guide or other control device documentation for specific network and device setup information. The next section provides a guide to configuring the card and AOiP port. What is in the iAM-MIX for Dante The Dante AOIP option consists of an Audinate Brooklyn II card directly connected to the AOIP port. This port is dedicated to the card and should not be confused with the Wohler unit Management port. These two ports must be on two different subnets, one for the AOIP network and the other for access to the Wohler Web GUI for management of the Wohler unit itself. Either one can be configured to have static or DHCP addresses. The Wohler Web GUI indicates the presence of the Dante card and the AOIP license but does not provide access to the various configuration parameters internal to the card. The speed of the AOIP port is 1G default or 100Mbps. The Audinate® Brooklyn II card has a simple process to set its initial IP address. The initial factory setting for the card’s AOIP port is DHCP. When connected to a DHCP based Dante network and the unit powered on, the Dante card sets the DHCP server provided address as its default address. Therefore, if the Dante network has a DHCP server, the unit can be inserted into the network and can be configured further using the Audinate application, Dante Controller, running on a host on the same DHCP based subnet. If the Dante network is static based or if DHCP fails, the card sets a static Link Local arbitrary address in the format 169.254.x.y, where x and y are each in the range 0 to 255. The mask is set to 255.255.0.0 to provide a ~65000 entry address space. The Dante Controller host must also have a Link Local address to communicate with the card over the unit’s AOIP port. Connect the AOIP port directly to a host (e.g. laptop) running the Dante Controller, where the host address is preconfigured to an arbitrary Link Local address (169.254.x.y, mask 255.255.0.0). The connection can be direct cable or through a switch. The Dante Controller Device Info tab shows iAM-MIX Page 63 the card’s default static address, speed, etc. By double clicking its entry line, additional settable parameters on the card can be reconfigured to be compatible with the Dante network addressing and other parameters as necessary. When the unit is rebooted on the Dante network, the card will be seen by the Dante Controller used to manage the overall network. If the Dante Controller Device Info tab detects the card but does not allow modification and full presentation of card internals, the Card ID will be shown in red, e.g. Wohler-xxxxxx where xxxxxx is the last 6 hex digits of the card MAC address as shown in B-1. This usually indicates that the IP address of the card is not in the same subnet as the Dante Controller host. By double clicking the ID, a Device View screen will appear as also shown in Figure B-1 with further details about the two incompatible addresses. Change the address of the host or move the unit to another host with an address compatible with the Dante card. Figure B-1 – Dante Controller Device Info Tab Card ID Device View Up to sixteen of the 64 AoIP receive channels can be monitored at once in the iAM- MIX. The sixteen iAM-MIX input channels selected by Presets are transmitted to the Dante network. The iAM-MIX Dante AoIP is configured by the iAM-MIX to receive up to 64 channels and transmit 62 channels of Dante AoIP at 48 kHz or 44.1 kHz audio sample rates. 48 kHz is the iAM-MIX default rate. Note: Contact Wohler for the Dante configuration software that enables transmission of up to 62 transmit channels. Sample rate selection is left up to the Dante Controller device or software. All devices connected to each other through a Dante network must be set to the same sample rate. Slight ticking may be heard in the iAM-MIX monitor when monitoring different input types at different sample rates or if the sources are asynchronous. iAM-MIX Page 64 Dante Device Setup The iAM-MIX’s default Dante Device Name is “Wohler- …” followed by the last 6 digits of the Dante port MAC address, as shown in Figure B-2. This name can be changed by the Dante Controller to appear that way on the network, but that will not change the iAM-MIX unit name appearing on GUI pages and iAM-MIX remote metering or discovery pages. Figure B–2: iAM-MIX Name Initial setup operators may want to manually change the iAM-MIX unit Name in the System Setup page to match the reassigned Dante Device Name for consistency. Refer to Figure B-3. Figure B–3: Rename iAM-MIX Other changes such as Latency settings can be made by the Dante Controller iAM-MIX Page 65 through the Device View menus. Some changes may require remote rebooting of the Brooklyn II card to take effect, temporarily interrupting audio and publishing the new information to the network. Dante Clock Selection While the Brooklyn’s internal clock is highly accurate, the iAM-MIX does not have provisions for external sync clocks, such as those that are GPS or media reference (video genlock or audio word clock) based. So it is generally not the best candidate to be the PTP Master Clock (commonly called the “grandfather clock”) for the network. It can be set as the preferred master if no better clock source exists. Refer to Figure B-4. The iAM-MIX Brooklyn Dante card will serve as a temporary fallback clock source if preferred masters are interrupted. It functions as an accurate slave clock synchronized to the master clock on the network when not operating as the master. Figure B–4: Clock Selection Channel Names The iAM-MIX uses the BKLYN-II default network channel names of Tx 01-16 and Rx 01-64. The network controller can change these names as desired, but iAM-MIX channel selections will remain as the original default numbers, unless changed in the Channel Naming - AoIP page. Note these iAM-MIX internal channel names are not passed to the Dante network for discovery purposes, and are internal to the iAM-MIX. It is recommended for best operator understanding and system administrator reference that channel name changes made over the Dante network be manually entered in the iAM-MIX Channel Naming - AoIP page to match. Important: Only 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz audio sample rates are currently supported by the iAM-MIX. The Brooklyn II card would accept a Dante Controller command to operate at other rates, without giving an indication it will not be implemented. iAM-MIX Page 66 AES67 The iAM-MIX Brooklyn II can be configured for AES67 operation. AES67 operation with Dante is limited to eight or less receive and transmit channels at 48 kHz sample rates. 24 bit linear (L24) encoding and 1 msec packet time are fixed default transmit parameters. 16 bit (L16) or 24 bit (L24) encoding and 125/250/333/100 µsec packet times can be received. The Device View - AES67 Config menu enables/disables AES67. Figure B–5: AES67 Enable/Disable iAM-MIX Page 67 Figure B–6: Device View - Network Config The channels to be multicast are selected in the File menu-Create Multicast Flows window shown in Figure B-7. Figure B–7: Multicast iAM-MIX Page 68 Stream Destinations Table B-1 illustrates the possible channel assignments in the iAM-MIX. Table B-1: Channel Assignments Channels iAM-MIX Assignment 0-15 Front Panel Channels 16-31 SDI-1 32-39 ASRC 48-57 Mute 58-61 Output Routing Mix Channels 62-63 Mute Device Lock Audinate recently added a feature whereby a remote controller can send a command to lock Dante network devices’ configurations. The iAM-MIX does not implement the Device Lock command at this time. Dante Firmware Upgrades Wohler iAM-MIX monitors ship with current Brooklyn II firmware as of the option installation date. The version information is found in the Dante Controller Device View-Status page. iAM-MIX software/firmware is tested with the latest Dante code release. Therefore it is strongly recommended that iAM-MIX and Dante software/ firmware be updated at the same time to ensure compatibility and support of the latest features. Use the Audinate Dante Firmware Update Manager Windows or OS X application to update the Dante firmware over the Dante network. Follow the application’s installation and usage guide plus any applicable technical notes available.

The iAM rear panel AoIP jack supports 1Gb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet devices in Ravenna Audio over IP network configurations. iAM-MIX channel source selections are made by choosing Input Type ‘AoIP’ in the Configuration-Configure Presets page regardless of which AoIP option is installed. Note: In addition to the iAM-MIX configuration, the Coveloz Bach board needs to configured using its own configuration tool. The menus in this configuration tool are shown in this Appendix. What is in the iAM-MIX for Ravenna The AES67 enabled Coveloz Bach board supports the following features: RAVENNA-compatible talker/listener: 1) RFC 3551 – RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences a) L16 16-bit linear format defined in RFC 3551 clause 4.5.11 b) L24 24-bit linear format defined in RFC 3190 clause 4 c) AM824 24-bit Audio as defined in IEC61883-6 d) Multicast and unicast session support e) 48 kHz and 96 kHz audio sampling rates f) 1 to 8 audio channels per stream g) Up to 256 streams 2) Media clock support a) 48 kHz and 96 kHz 3) Hitless Stream Redundancy 4) IGMP v3 support 5) Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) support AVB Ethernet features: AVB uses the concept of streams and channels. A stream is a connection from one talker to one or more listeners. One stream can be made up of 1-60 audio channels. The Ravenna option supports the following AVB features: 1) AVB 1722 AVTP with multiple subtypes: a) IEC 61883-6 MBLA b) AM824, 24-bit Audio Encapsulation c) Support up to 64 streams d) Up to 8 channels per stream e) 512+512 Channels of audio f) 48kHz and 96kHz sampling rates 2) IEEE 802.1Q/SRP iAM-MIX Page 71 3) IEEE 1722.1/AVDECC control 4) IEEE 802.1AS/gPTP 5) Compatible with Apple OS X devices, such as MacBooks and MacMini computers 6) Media clock per the AVnu specification 7) Hitless stream redundancy BACH™ Controller Graphical User Interface: The BACH board includes a Graphical User Interface to review and manage the Bach board. It provides an interface to: 1) Manage connections with ease a) Display discovered devices and streams b) Connect streams from network to local destinations c) Start, stop and monitor stream health/status 2) Enable local BACH™ device configuration & status reporting. Examples include: a) Receive buffer statistics b) Ethernet statistics c) Alarms The context is device-specific, meaning that: 1) a stream “source” refers to this device’s source 2) One can change context to another device by selecting it on the Cloud Page iAM-MIX Page 72 Home Page You can navigate to different pages within the Bach Controller GUI to review or perform various functions. The Home page can be accessed by entering the 172.27.2.30 IP address. It gives a device overview and stream status. Figure C–1: BACH Controller Home Page Configuration/Device Management The Configuration page allows operations such as modifying the IP address, Packet time, Rebooting and so forth. The first step in setting up the Ravenna option is to configure the Ethernet IP address and other settings. The Device Configuration page allows operations such as modifying the IP address, Packet time, Rebooting etc. Note: There are important considerations when setting up a Ravenna network. Ideally, the Ravenna network must be completely isolated from other Ethernet devices, such as computers, printers, and connections to the internet. This is because the timing of the communications on the Ravenna network is very critical. It should have its own 1Gbps router. However, at least one computer must be connected to the Ravenna network to perform configuration. Set the Ethernet IP address of the Ravenna option into the \"eth1\" line on the Device Configuration page. The address must be on the same subnet as the other devices on the Ravenna network. Note: The \"eth0\" setting is not to be used. Leave it at its default setting. Next, check that the Sampling Frequency is 48 kHz and the Packet Time is 1ms or 250us. Check that the Firmware Version is the same as what is shown in Figure B- iAM-MIX Page 73 3. Note: ALL Devices must use the same packet time, or sources or destinations may not be available. If you change any setting on the Device Configuration page, click Save Running to Startup. If you have changed any Ethernet IP addresses, click Reboot Device. Note: The Ravenna card requires knowledge of its IP address in order for you to use its Web Client for further configuration. Note: If you change the default IP address (172.27.2.30) to another Static address, make sure you document this change by writing down the new IP address and affixing it to the rear panel for your future reference. If you forget the new IP address, it can be very difficult to find it again. Important: Setting the card into DHCP mode should be done only if the user has a convenient way to discover the newly assigned dynamic address. At minimum, we suggest setting the card to a Static address for initial testing. Ideally, all cards on the network should be visible to a Ravenna/AES67 network manager where dynamic IP addresses are readily knowable. The Web Client Cloud menu section may suffice as the network manager. If you lose track of the IP address of a card, the only way to find it is to connect it to a very small network consisting of a computer, a switch and the card. Then use Wireshark or equivalent to discover its IP address. Figure C–2: BACH Controller Device Configuration iAM-MIX Page 74 Controller Cloud The Cloud page shows any Ravenna devices on the given network, including any Wohler devices with the Ravenna option installed. Figure C–3: BACH Controller Cloud Page iAM-MIX Page 75 Sync The Sync page allows you to program parameters relating to Precision Time Protocol (PTP) based time synchronization of network clocks of your BACH-AES67 devices. Figure C–4: BACH Controller Sync Page iAM-MIX Page 76 Source Streams The Source provides in-depth information on source streams that are transmitting (sourcing) Ravenna signals from devices on the network. Figure C–5: BACH Controller Source Stream iAM-MIX Page 77 Stream Destinations The Destination page provides in-depth information on your destination devices that are receiving Ravenna signals on the network. Clicking the Advanced button provides additional options. Note: The Destinations must be set to ON. Table C-1 illustrates the possible channel assignments in the iAM-MIX.

The highlighted green square indicates a routing connection between a source or talker (left) and a destination or listener (bottom). The Web GUI will allow selection of channels to monitor from among the listeners (bottom). Figure C–7: BACH Controller Patch Panel Troubleshooting It can happen that the iAM-MIX Ravenna option doesn't immediately operate as expected. This can be the result of a variety of causes. Refer to Table C-2 for solutions to the problem. If after following the advice in the table, you still cannot resolve the issue please contact Wohler Technical Services for additional help. Contact information is on the second page of this manual. Table C-2: Troubleshooting Symptom Possible Solutions 1. Restart the iAM-MIX. 2. Restart the unit that doesn't show up. Source or destination doesn't show up on the network 3. Restart the network. Cannot open a web page for either a source or a destination 1. Go to the Cloud page of a working device and see if the source or destination is listed there. This will help determine whether the IP address was changed or simply entered incorrectly. iAM-MIX Page 79 2. Use software such as Wireshark* to check network traffic. 3. Empty the cache of the browser. 1. Go to the Destinations tab, delete all of the destinations and then try to route again. 2. Make sure that the source is turned on. Cannot route to a destination 3. Go to the Dashboard page and check the Sources and Destination blocks. Verify that they are ready and working without timing errors. Wireshark is a free and open sourced packet analyzer software program. It can be used to analyze network traffic and locate IP addresses being used. It may be downloaded from www.wireshark.org. Ravenna Firmware Upgrades Wohler iAM-MIX monitors ship with current Bach firmware as of the option installation date. The version information is found in the Firmware section of the Bach Device Configuration page. iAM-MIX software/firmware is tested with the latest Bach code release. Therefore it is strongly recommended that iAM-MIX and Bach software/ firmware be updated at the same time to ensure compatibility and support of the latest features. If a Ravenna software update is indicated, follow instructions in the Coveloz Ravenna software update materials. iAM-MIX Page 80 APPENDIX D: Ravenna (ZMAN) Setup Introduction Installing the iAM-MIX into an existing and functioning Ravenna network using the Merging ZMAN Card is virtually plug and play. The iAM rear panel AoIP jack supports 1Gb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet devices in Ravenna Audio over IP network configurations. iAM-MIX channel source selections are made by choosing Input Type ‘AoIP’ in the Configuration-Configure Presets page regardless of which AoIP option is installed. Note: In addition to the iAM-MIXconfiguration, the Merging ZMAN Card needs to be configured using its own configuration tool. The menus in this configuration tool are shown in this Appendix. What is in the iAM-MIX for Ravenna The AES67 enabled Merging ZMAN Card supports the following features: RAVENNA-Compatible Talker/Listener 1) RFC 3551 – RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences a) L16 16-bit linear format defined in RFC 3551 clause 4.5.11 b) L24 24-bit linear format defined in RFC 3190 clause 4 c) AM824 24-bit Audio as defined in IEC61883-6 d) Multicast and unicast session support e) 48 kHz and 96 kHz audio sampling rates f) 1 to 8 audio channels per stream g) Up to 64 streams 2) Media clock support a) 48 kHz and 96 kHz 3) Hitless Stream Redundancy 4) IGMP v3 support 5) Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) support AVB Ethernet Features AVB uses the concept of streams and channels.

The Merging card can be configured through a connection to the Ethernet AOIP Port using a browser on the Ravenna network and by using the Merging Aneman Windows application. Aneman is available for free download at: https://www.merging.com/support/downloads#aneman The iAM-MIX can be configured using its Front Panel controls or its web interface through its Management port. Details specific to the iAM-MIX can be found in Chapters 2 and 4 of this manual. For a Quick Start, set the Source Select menu item on the Front Panel to AOIP to configure iAM-MIX to receive/source a Ravenna Stream over its AOIP port. The Source Select Menu control also allows selection of a range of channels in groups of 16 channels 1-16 … 49-64. More details including definition of Presets and individual channel parameters are available by reference to other chapters of this manual. The Merging Ravenna card runs specific firmware from Merging and augmented by Wohler for use within the iAM-MIX. The card will not function correctly if the user downloads and installs firmware from any source besides Wohler. The Wohler augmentation includes the ability to support 64 channels. The Merging card is pre-configured to DHCP mode to obtain its IP address automatically from the Ravenna network. The Ravenna network should be a separate address space from the iAM-MIX Management port. For example, the iAM- MIX might be connected to a 10.11.11 subnet and the Ravenna network devices connected together on a 10.15.15 subnet. Aneman and a suitable browser must be resident on a host workstation on the same Ravenna subnet to access the Merging card. For this Appendix, the Ravenna network address will be referred to as <Ravenna subnet>. The Merging card address will then be <Ravenna subnet>.x where x is the specific address of the card on the subnet. Power the iAM-MIX and verify the Ethernet connector LEDs are lit and/or blinking. It may take a few minutes for the card to be fully recognized on the Ravenna network after powering the iAM-MIX. For Aneman access, the card parameters including its IP address should appear in a panel at the bottom of the screen. In Aneman, make sure Devices under Menu iAM-MIX Page 82 item View is enabled. Do not proceed until the card shows on Aneman. Right click on that line and select Web Services: Advanced (or Ravenna) to bring up the Merging Ravenna configuration page. Also, the ICON of the card will appear in the main part of the Aneman screen. Double Clicking on the ICON also will load the Configuration screen. For browser access, the URL is <Ravenna subnet>.x/advanced/index.html. This brings up the Merging Ravenna configuration page. Each tab is explained in the following sections. Getting Started | General Settings This tab is shown in the following figure. Figure D-1: Getting Started | General Settings The elements of this tab are as follows: 1. Device Name: Enter a useful Device Name for the card, which will show up on other Ravenna devices on the subnet. 2. Sample Rate: (44100-48000- 88200-96000-176400-192000-352800- 384000) 3. Frame size (@1Fs): current frame size (64 - AES67/48 - 32 -16 - 12 -6). 4. Safety Playout Delay (@1Fs): The value is described at 1Fs (44.1-48 kHz) in samples. For example, if the value is 10, the additional playout delay will be 20 at 2Fs (88.2-96 kHz), 40 at 4FS (176.4-192 kHz) 5. SSM Source-Specific Multicast: If needed, configure the network switch for IGMP V3. 6. Network Interface: Note the address of the card and its type (Zeroconf, DHCP, Static). (If necessary, the address can be changed to another type such as a Static address which must include a Network Mask and Gateway.) iAM-MIX Page 83 Getting Started | PTP This tab is shown in the following figure. This configuration page refers to how your Ravenna network is synchronized to clocks. Figure D-2: Getting Started | PTP The elements of this tab are as follows: 1. Global Settings: The default value for PTP a. Domain: For the Merging Ravenna card this value is 0. b. DSCP: 46 for PTP AES67 or 48 for PTP Ravenna. 2. Master: To modify the PTP setting, you must first check the \"Manual\" checkbox. a. Priority: 1 is the main priority value. b. Class: This is the Device class. This value should not be modified. c. Accuracy: This field cannot be modified. d. Priority 2: This is only used if the other parameters do not allow electing a PTP master. e. GMID: This is the current GrandMasterID (PTP Master) f. Slave only: This forces the Merging device to always be PTP slave. g. Delay Mech.: This is PTP Profile related - E2E or P2P h. Announce: This is PTP Profile related - PTP announcement interval (1 - 2 - 4 - 8 -16 seconds) i. Sync: This is PTP Profile related (0.0625 - 0.125 - 0.25 - 0.5 seconds) iAM-MIX Page 84 3. Status: a.

Delta (ns): This is the time delta between the device and the PTP master. 4. Graph: The graph is only active for slave devices and shows the device delta against Master PTP clock. 5. PTP Priority Value: a. 1 is the highest priority, 255 the lowest one. b. Merging card is by default using Priority 127 when set as PTP Master and 255 when PTP slave. Getting Started | Session Sources This tab defines which Streams are to be Sourced from this card. It is shown in the following figure. Figure D-3: Getting Started | Session Sources The elements of this tab are as follows: 1. Create session button: Create a new session sources by clicking on left ICON. 2. IO: Select the physical input (when applicable). 3. Name: This is the Source name. 4. Advertise: Check to enable source advertising on the network. 5. Auto-unicast - (RTSP): Check to automatically retrieve the sink (listener) IP address:port for unicast connection. 6. Address: This the stream’s multicast address. Note that the user defined checkbox is activated automatically when entering a multicast address manually. iAM-MIX Page 85 7. TTL: Time to Live (also called Hop Limit) - This value should not be modified. 8. Payload type: RTP Payload type - This value should not be modified. 9. Codec: The possible bit rate values are L24, L16, DSD64, DSD64_32, DSD128, DSD128_32, and DSD256. Note that these values are sampling rate dependent. 10.Frame size (samples): This the frame size of the current source. 11.DSCP: The audio DSCP should be set to 34 for RTP AES67 or 46 for RTP Ravenna. 12.RefClk PTP traceable: This feature is useful when you want to connect a stream through Internet (for example with two PTP Masters (GPS) at each location). This allows making connections with devices locked to different traceable PTP Masters. Refer also to Ignore RefClk GMID - accept source locked to any PTP master, on the Session Sinks tab. 13.Channels: This is the number of channels in the stream. The drop-down menu allows selection of specific channel range if the number of channels is less than 8. 14.The URL of the SDP of this session: This allows saving of the Session Description into a file, which is useful for specific third party devices if a manual SDP has to be provided. Getting Started | Session Sinks This tab defines streams which are sinked in this card. It is shown in the following figure. Figure D-4: Getting Started | Session Sinks The elements of this tab are as follows: 1. Create session button: Create new session sinks by clicking on left ICON. 2. IO: Select the physical output (when applicable). 3. Label: This is the Sink name. iAM-MIX Page 86 4. Source: This is a drop down menu to select a source (both sap and bonjour advertised sources are automatically listed). 5. Manual: This allows manual entry of an SDP. 6. Delay (samples): This sets the playback delay. 0 is automatic delay. 7. Ignore RefClk GMID - accept source locked to any PTP master: This feature is useful when you want to connect a stream through Internet (for example with two PTP Masters (GPS) at each location. This allows making of connections with devices locked to different traceable PTP Masters. See RefClk PTP traceable on the Session Sources tab. 8. Channels: Channel count: The drop-down menu allows selection of specific channel range if the number of channels is smaller than 8. Getting Started | Session Info 1. RTP Status: The following bit positions indicate the connection status: 0x10: receiving RTP packets (OK) 0x01: wrong RTP sequence id 0x02: wrong RTP SSRC 0x04: wrong RTP payload type 0x08: wrong RTP SAC 0x20 stream has been muted 0x40: Horus implementation - an incoming stream is muted Important Note: The above error numbers are summed. For example, Stream Muted and Wrong Payload together are indicated by 0x24. 2. Playout Delay: This is the current playout delay on the selected sink in samples and ms. 3. RTSP Host: This is the connected source IP Session name: defined in SDP (usually the same as the source name) 4. Clock Domain: This is the PTP clock type and domain 5. Payload: Selections are Payload / Codec / Sampling Rate / Number of Channels 6. SDP: This displays detailed SDP information on the current stream. iAM-MIX Page 87 Getting Started | Ins/Outs This tab allows you to change the name of the specific Inputs and/or Outputs. Figure D-5: Getting Started | Ins/Outs Getting Started | I/O Router This page allows remapping of incoming channels to different internal channel assignments. For example, Stream channel 1 can be remapped to Merging card Channel 0, and so on. Figure D-6: Getting Started | I/O Router iAM-MIX Page 88 Operation: Connecting Remote Source to Local Sink This instruction assumes another Ravenna device is active on the network and sourcing a multicast stream. The Merging Configuration section for Session Sink controls how to configure the card to receive the stream and provide it to the IAM interface for display on meters and speakers, etc. The iAM-MIX must be set to receive AOIP from the Source Select Front Panel menu or a browser iAM-MIX GUI. Ravenna Streams can contain up to 8 channels of information. The collections of channels in a specific Stream are termed Flows. For example, to source an SDI 16 channel signal might be accomplished by two Flows, each consisting of 8 channels. A stereo AES Flow consists of one Flow of two channels. ZMAN Session Sinks This assumes that 1 or more sources are present on the AOIP Ravenna network. Right Select Advanced on the entry for the Merging ZMAN device in Aneman. This brings up the browser page with tab set to General configuration GUI for the ZMAN card. This is shown in Figure D-1. Use the following procedure: 1. Select the Session Sinks tab and use the Create Session Sinks icon (in the upper left corner) to see the available source Flows. 2. Create an entry on the left panel for each source Flow to be configured. 3. Select the desire Flow and set the number of channels in the Flow. Select the desired range to direct the Flow to the internal channels of the iAM-MIX. 4. Click the matrix, as shown in Figure D-7, to direct the incoming channels to the desired iAM-MIX channels. For example, a 16 channel SDI source consists of two 8 channel Flows. One could be mapped to channels 1-8 and the other could be mapped to 9-16. Notice that the Tab I/O Router duplicates the Session Sinks matrix and can be used to map channels from input source assignments to iAM-MIX channels also. Input channels can be mapped to more than one iAM-MIX channel by selecting additional matrix elements to map input channels 1-8 to both 1-8 and 9-16. iAM-MIX Page 89 Figure D-7: Session Sinks Tab To avoid confusion if monitoring more than one Flow, especially if the various source Flows have overlapping channel numbers, use the matrix to direct Flows to higher channel ranges. For example, for monitoring 2 SDI sources (four 8 channel Flows), assign two flows to 1-8 and 9-16 and the next SDI signal to 17-24 and 25- 32. Touch the iAM-MIX AOIP selection menu to select the proper range to monitor, up to 57-64. Select Apply to enable the Sink process, which results in the meters and audio becoming available on the iAM-MIX. iAM-MIX Page 90 ZMAN Session Sources If the ZMAN card is to Source Flows, use the Session Sources tab. Refer to Figure D-8. The procedure is similar to defining Sinks with the additional step to provide the Flow a name to appear on other units in the network. Select the channel range with a maximum of 8 channels per Flow. Figure D-8: Session Sources Tab ZMAN Updating The Zman card is pre-initialized with the correct Wohler firmware load. In case of future upgrades, use the following steps: 1. In Aneman, right click the ZMAN entry on the bottom Devices section, and select Maintenance Mode. This brings up a web page which prompts for the location of the Wohler provided upgrade file. The file should resemble the following: firmware_1.1.7b43263_18Jun20.wohler 2. Select this file and click Open. On the web, select Update to install the firmware. 3. After successful completion, select Reboot to reboot the ZMAN card. 4. Close the web pages and return to Aneman to set up Sources and Sinks. iAM-MIX Page 91 APPENDIX E: API Documentation Introduction This appendix discusses ways to use the Application Program Interface (API) Version 2, which allows third party equipment to remotely access options and settings of the iAM-MIX. It includes specific code examples for commonly used requests. The API uses JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) as its communication language. Follow the instructions in the First Time IP Assignments section of Chapter 4 to achieve the required network connection.
