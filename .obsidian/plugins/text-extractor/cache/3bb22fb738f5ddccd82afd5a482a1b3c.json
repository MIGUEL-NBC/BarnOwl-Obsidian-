By accomplishing this, they should be cleaner in the racks and easier to track/maintain. We also removed the old Quibi Ultimattes that were no longer in use in Rack 50. After we completed the moves this evening, we had the control rooms fax the MSNBC units again and we got the greenlight from Ops. However, if any issues or reports come in tomorrow about Ultimattes, please reach out for assistance. Below is the latest tracker with all the MSNBC unit info including rack locations. Right below the grid is a link to the central shared Ultimatte tracker doc with more detailed info and rack elevations. This doc also includes the SNL Ultimattes. I forgot to relabel them in 7N :( Forgive me, will get labels redone ASAP. https://nbcuni-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/206102811_tfayd_com/EUX- wwE1y1FOmaSW2hrrE4IBsZYUZccUiNo3YvoDt6sBDw?e=rYPbJB Please reach out with any questions.
