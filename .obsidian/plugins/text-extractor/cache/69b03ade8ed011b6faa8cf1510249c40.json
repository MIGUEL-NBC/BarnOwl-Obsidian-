When a problem occurs then go to Page icon in the upper left corner of the MENU Display. When the numeric keypad window appears, use the Shut Down button to shut down the system.  Note: IF THE MENU IS LOCKED UP AND UNABLE TO BE SHUT DOWN THEN GO TO THE NEXT STEP (2A). OTHERWISE, PROCEED TO STEP 3 (on the following slide). 2A. It may be necessary to have a USB mouse and/or Keyboard connected to one of the Memory module USB ports, because in the case of a lockup, the MENU may not be operating but the mouse may still be able to work. Shut Down may be accessed using this method. Otherwise, see step 2b Using a USB Keyboard. 2B. Using a USB Keyboard - Press CTRL+ALT+F2 to access Linux. Login as “root”. Type “logbackup”, then ENTER. After this is executed then type “shutdown”, then ENTER. Log Sampling  The log sample is saved when the system is officially SHUT DOWN using the shut down button. At that time only, the logs are updated with current data. Therefore follow the procedure below:  Log Sampling is in menu #9999. The procedure is: 3 3. When the Menu display is Black, then power cycle the SCU (MKS- 8010A). 4. Wait 2 minutes for the System to power up. When Initialize stops, insert a Memory device and configure it for primary (menu #7317 refresh, then set device to Primary). 5. Go to Menu #9999 and press Log Sample. 6. Remove the Memory device and save data to a folder. Zip and send the folder with contents to SONY Service.  If you do not use Shut Down, then the log files will not be updated. Power cycle of the SCU without a shut down will delete the last useable log data and you will be left with the previous data before the problem occurred. In other words it will be useless to get a Log Sample unless you Shut Down after the problem occurs.
