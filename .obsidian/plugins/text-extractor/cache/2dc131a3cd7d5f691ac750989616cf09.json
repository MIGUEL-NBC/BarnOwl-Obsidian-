Format Converter Block The input format converter block consists of an input connector board and an FC-112 board. The output format converter block consists of an OUT-35/35A board and an output connector board. FC-112 board (MKS-8450X) The FC-112 board performs the following processing. . Generates a clock signal and a timing signal in synchronization with the reference signal, which are used in the FC- 112 board. . Up to two FC-112 boards can be mounted in the MVS-8000X. Each board is capable of format conversion for eight channels (HD formatting). (Format conversion for four channels in the case of 3G formatting) . Up to one FC-112 board can be mounted in the MVS-7000X. This board is capable of format conversion for eight channels (HD formatting). (Format conversion for four channels in the case of 3G formatting) . The local CPU on the XPT-31 board controls the FC-112 board. The 8-channel or 16-channel SDI signals sent from the input connector board are converted to parallel signals using the clock and timing signals generated by the FC-112 board. The parallel signals are transferred through the interface block to the format converter block where format conversion is performed. The converted signals are transferred again through the interface block and converted to serial signals. The converted serial signals are sent to the XPT-31 board.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
