Each LED cabinet (panel) may be equipped with redundant or non - redundant power supplies and receiving cards, and perform noiselessly with a fanless design. Primary LED Panel Components • L ED Cabinet o The metal frame and rear enclosure that contains the entire panel components. • LED Module o Contains the individual diodes that make up a pixel. o Contains the PCB and IC drivers for powering the diodes. • Hub Card • Receiving Card o Receives video and configuration data from the LED controller. Multiple receiving cards are used depending on pixel count and redundancy. • IO/Power Connector o In the cableless design, there is a power/data connector at the top and bottom of each cabinet. Some connector s may be on the rear of the cabinet at either the top or bottom. • Status Indicator Lights o On the rear of the LED cabinet are status lights displaying status for the power and data. 3 (2 6 0 ) 4 9 4 - 14 9 9 LE D V i d e o D i sp l ay S o l u t i o n s www. n e o t i . c o m Proper Handling All LED panels , modules, and diodes are susceptible to damage due to improper handling or contact. To protect against damage, please take note of the following precautions: • Take extreme caution when touching the face or edges of the LED modules and diodes. The highest probability of diod e damage will happen around the outside edges of the modules. Care should be taken when changing or handling modules. • Remove any loose or large jewelry before cleaning or handling the LED modules or panels to avoid scratching or inadvertently damaging dio des. • Grounding yourself to release any built - up static electricity before touch the LED modules or panels is always suggested. This can be as simple as touching another metal object before touching the LED panels. • Lint - free gloves may be worn when handling panels or modules to avoid dust or oils being transferred. Cleaning EXTREME CAUTION must be observed when performing any cleaning method described below: • NO LIQUID MAY BE USED TO CLEAN ANY PART OF THE LED PANEL. • Front of Video Wall o The front o f the video wall may be dusted with compressed air – at least 6 - 8” from the face of the modules. DO NOT focus high pressure on any single point of the wall. Use wide sweeping motions – never stop in a single spot. o A lint - free, super - soft bristled brush o r duster may be used on the front of the modules – test a small, inconspicuous portion of the screen first to ensure that no dust or residue is left behind from the brush or duster. • Back of Video Wall o A soft cloth or duster may be used to dust the back side of the video wall cabinets. 4 (2 6 0 ) 4 9 4 - 14 9 9 LE D V i d e o D i sp l ay S o l u t i o n s www. n e o t i . c o m Troubleshooting Only trained personnel should attempt any repair work on the LED panels.

If any of the numbers are not illuminated (and should be), there may be a cable malfunction – either one the RJ45 ends, or the cable itself. ü Verify that the controller is receiving a proper INPUT signal (on the fro nt of the controller display). ü Verify that the proper INPUT is selected on the front of the controller (SDI, DVI, HDMI, ETC). ü Power cycle the column, row, or panel (by unplugging and then plugging in the power cable). ý PRO BL EM : A p i x e l o r s e c t i o n o f a mo d u l e i s b l a c k o r d i s c o l o r e d . ü Replace the module with a spare, and send the malfunctioning module to Neoti for warranty or damage repair.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
