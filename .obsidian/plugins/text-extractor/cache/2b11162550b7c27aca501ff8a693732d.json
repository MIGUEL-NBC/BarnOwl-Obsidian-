The templates arranged by Concept, which is generally the show, utilities, etc. Within each concept are the various templates. The main types of templates you will see are ones that contain either a graphic or a clip. In a clip template, it will bring up the Media tab, which are clips that were transferred to Viz One by artists or coordinators. Problems here are generally caused by Viz One issues, or simply incorrect search criteria. The other allows the user to upload an image, most frequently dragged in from the Dali Plugin. Dali is accessible either as an inews plugin (through inews or an icon on the desktop) or through the dali.inbcu.com page. They can only drag into Viz Pilot from the plugin. Clicking the 'eye' button within a template will open the Preview window. These are generated by one of the three Viz Frame Servers. If preview is not loading or says disconnected, troubleshoot the engines.
