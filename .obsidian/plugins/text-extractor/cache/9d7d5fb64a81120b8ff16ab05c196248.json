LNC: ELC service launcher, starts with windows and turns on boot, this starts all other services. In services will see other services in manual. Needs about a minute to go through LOGC: ELC Log collector. 10k logs on mirrored, 20-30k logs on main server, all button presses and options not pressed, literally everything is logged. At 1am all logs on main will be auto zipped and sent to 2nd server and held there for 60 days. DB SRC: where is DB hosted, normally on main and MIRR is running on 2. Web SRV; web service for gui AL MGR: alarm manager, runs on 02 so that you can access it if there is an issue on 01. This shows the above alarms as it will tell you if anything is wrong. MSCK: opens a network port between iNews and mos gateway. All iNews goes through here. No need to reboot for the most part, iNews has its own gateway that’s what needs to be restarted M-GW: mos gateway, gets a bunch of info from mos and inputs into local db. Shot MGR: service that opens comms to iNews (plug in) this is what manages the connection between iNews and ELC NRCS GW: FTP connection to iNews server, logs on as a user to connect OA MGR: On air manager, this is the application that runs on the PCs in control room. EC: Event Controller. Running the show, talking to all different devices. DC talks to the switcher and devices switcher is connected to. Everything IP based through EC. Instant connection and resumes if disconnect and reconnect. DC: Device Controller can't start and stop part of EC OAPL: on air playlist application used to start control of show ICON Manager: set up icons in show will show green when running on a particular server. Can only be running on 1 system. INI_SET: initial setup SBM: shot box module, makes an IP connection to shot boxes XVS BRIDG: if there is an XVS switcher uses this to communicate used in 74 PHY Bridge: can be used for remote control in remote location physical devices elsewhere and it can control and this service manages that. To reboot, make sure green labels are closed(OAPL etc.), and do windows restart. If something is running, go close it first. ELC 01 and 02 on KVM in 2E or remote into. Windows username is Administrator with above password. elcsupport@am.sony.com <--support line for non-emergency or general questions 855-sony-sys <--- emergency 8am-12am LVL 1 support All services will move over to secondary server Don't do a failover without calling ELC first Log Viewer: Can use this to immediate collect, has options to grab setup data and stuff, include date and time info as close as possible and rundown info etc. On Calrec there is a button to enable remote control. RAP or ROSS. If you see alarm saying audio mixer is not connected that should be checked. If you see audio fader that’s the JL cooper fader in the control room. potential bad fader, swap with spare, can get more overnighted from Paramus. • Director has ability to override a setting. If the take button is hit and a fader is touched, there is a touch sense and it will be ignored. If issue happens once likely touch sense issue, if it happens throughout show may be bad fader. • 8 different fader modules, director has the ability to modify levels of faders, can save temp new defaults for a single show. Fader can be saved as closed by accident and will load as closed. • JL Cooper troubleshooting: To reboot shot box, based on build, unplug power supply locally, or if in a pop+ switch, unplug network cable. To be safe just pull power. Cannot be done remotely. Use this to set new fader IP if replaced. Use below Network resource registration to determine which device LAN to use. Device Installer application on windows, pick device LAN hit okay, and it will search for that new device. In Setup GUI, Network resource registration, you can find the IP of what it should be, go back to device installer, and reIP. IT will reboot and take over primary, make sure the primary is Station Registration will show you all server IPS. If lagging, ask for information on what page etc. so we can get info to ask ELC. 248-320-3683 - Jason.Weintraub@sony.com ELC Page 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
