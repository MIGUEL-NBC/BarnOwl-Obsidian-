CONFIGURE GPIS FOR DRY/WET OPERATION GPIs are set to Dry operation by default. The GPIs may be set for Wet mode using either a GTP-32 Breakout Panel or using jumpers within the GTP-32. To configure the jumpers inside the GTP-32: 1) Power down the GTP-32. 2) Using a Phillips screwdriver, remove the top cover from the GTP-32. To do so, you will need to remove the screws from each side of the unit, 2 from the rear, and 1 from the center of the front of the unit. For SN# 502207 and above the front panel screw has been replaced with a push rivet. Click-Lock Shank—Place in the hole and press the head. When you hear a snap, the shaft has expanded and the rivet is secured. Pry to remove. 3) The GPIO card is on the far right hand side of the unit (if facing the front panel), behind the GPIO connectors. 4) The jumpers for the GPIs are directly behind the GPI connectors, labeled J7 through J38. Each set of jumpers for a GPI consists of 4 pins. See the table below for which GPI corresponds to which jumpers. GPI ConnectorsGPO Connectors J7 J22 J23 J38 Pin 1 Pin 2 Pin 3 Pin 4 Flex Control Network®, DC20 / DC21 User Manual Page 25 5) For Dry operation, set one jumper across pins 2 and 3. Hang the second jumper off of pin 1. 6) For Wet operation, set one jumper across pin 1 and 2. Set the second jumper across pins 3 and 4. 7) Once all necessary changes to the jumpers have been made, replace the top cover and screws on the GTP-32.
