An easy-to- understand Windows® based Event Viewer application gives Operations and Engineering the timely information they need to quickly react and resolve issues. The Event Viewer application runs on the operator s workstation displaying a reverse chronological listing of received, missing, and late events for all monitored playout channels. Missing and late events are easily identified to facilitate timely corrective action. Workstation may be configured to monitor all, or a selected group of playout channels. Schedule Mode / Live Mode DPI Signal / System Monitor offers two modes of operation: 1. Scheduled Mode monitors the Broadcast Playlist for DPI signals & events and notifies the Event Viewer of received, missing, and late events. 2. Live Mode monitors DPI signals & critical events as they happen and notifies the Event Viewer of received events. Built on Flex Control Network® All DPI signal and event monitoring is handled by Flex Control Network®, DNF s popular, field-proven, Ethernet-based, distributed control platform. Flex integrates control across devices and facilities. It enables monitoring and control from a single or multiple locations , either with exclusive or shared control. Flex Control Network s DC21 Device Controller monitors a wide range of devices over Ethernet, Serial, and GPI/O. Using a standard web-browser, users can easily configure the DC21 to monitor selected signals and events. DPI signals are de-embedded from HD-SDI and ASI streams using off-the-shelf de-embedders, then fed into the DC21 for processing. Real-time notifications are sent from the DC21 to the Event Viewer when a monitored event occurs, is late, or has been missed. Also, error notifications may be sent to other DC21 Device Controllers and GTP-32 Control Processors to generate an email, display a monitor wall notification, and/or trigger visual & aural alert indicators. Error notifications may also be configured to trigger replacement SCTE messages and take other corrective action . Scalable The DPI Signal / System Monitor readily scales from a single DC21 Device Controller to multiple interconnected DC21s and GTP-32 Control Processors located within the facility or worldwide.
