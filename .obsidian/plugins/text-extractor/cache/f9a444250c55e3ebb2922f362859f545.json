The IP addresses can be found at https://nbcuni.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/GFXTechnology/EZcv_WlSloVEiCkgqNOV_tcBOWhN0zBu6E1eQ3RYj QVYCw?e=c2etsx but channel assignments can change as the system is fully routable. Always check Magnum SDVN or a control room “far” UMD to confirm the physical playout device that is feeding a CR DDR. Other server types should remain persistent. Procedure: 1. From a jumpbox, open a web browser (Chrome recommended) and go the IP of the server from the spreadsheet linked above. 2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page under quick actions and click “Download Logs ” 3. This will open a blank webpage for several minutes while the logs are zipped and then a .tar file will be downloaded, copy this to OneDrive for distribution to the vendor. 4. Repeat the above for all servers involved. If it is a playout server that has had an issue with video or audio output continue to follow the below steps then repeat for all servers involved. 5. DC-Playout servers have additional logging for the video IO card that feeds the router ST-2110. These must be retrieved off the server using a file transfer software such as WinSCP or Filezilla. From a jumpbox, open one of those applications and enter the server IP from the table above.

All examples shown will be using WinSCP and the program will typically land in the user folder, return to the root directory by clicking the icon that looks like a file folder with a forward slash (/) in it on the right side of the explorer. 7. Navigate the directory /var/tmp/MatroxVideo and copy the entire ‘DXS.utils’ folder from the server. 8. Return to the root directory using step 6 and then navigate to /dev/ and copy the entire ‘MatroxVideo’ folder from the server. 9. Copy both directories to OneDrive for distribution to the vendor for troubleshooting.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
