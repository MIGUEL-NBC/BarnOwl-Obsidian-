Why now?  Challenges Where We Are Company Confidential  An optical fiber is a long thin strand of impurity-free glass used as a transport medium for data.  A typical point-to-point fiber optic communication network consists of a transmitter (laser), a transport medium (optical fiber) and a receiver (photo-diode) Troubleshooting Basics - Fiber Company Confidential  Optical fiber has many advantages over traditional copper cable and free-space microwave networks: • Less signal degradation per meter • Higher signal carrying capacity / bandwidth • Less costly per meter • Lighter and thinner than copper wire • Free from electromagnetic interference (Poor weather does not affect signal) • Lower transmitter launching power • Flexible (used in medical and mechanical imaging systems) Troubleshooting Basics - Advantages of Fiber Company Confidential  A properly functioning fiber optic network requires clinical cleanliness of all fiber optic connections.  A single particle of dust or fingerprint can scatter enough optical power from the core to take down an entire link.  While not in use all fiber connector tips should be covered with dust caps to prevent damage such as scratches and pits from forming on the connector ends.  Pits and scratches on the surface of a connector can migrate when mated to another connector.  To avoid damaging fiber connectors Evertz recommends cleaning both ends of the fiber connection prior to mating using a Cletop Reel Troubleshooting Basics - Care for Fibers Company Confidential  SFP’s are designed for optical communication between equipment and devices.  They come in a range of bandwidths: 1Gb/s, 10Gb/s, 25Gb/s, 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s  In addition to bandwidth restrictions, SFP’s can also be purchased based on Wavelength requirements and Distance  Evertz offers: MM (multimode) 850nm and SM (singlemode) 1310nm as standard • In addition for longer reach applications Evertz offers 1550nm SFP’s Company Confidential  Why do we use multicast? • Unicast messages are sent from one device to another device; they are not intended for others • Have to send multiple of these to send the same message to specific devices • Takes a significant amount of bandwidth • Multicast messages make it easy to send multiple parties the same information simultaneously • By doing this there is significant bandwidth savings Unicast vs. Multicast Company Confidential  Information that is placed before the actual data. The header normally contains a small number of control- information bytes, which are used to communicate important facts about the data that the message contains and how it is to be interpreted and used. It serves as the communication and control link between protocol elements on different devices. Header Company Confidential  The actual data to be transmitted, often called the payload of the message Data Company Confidential Transport of High Bit Rate Media Signals over IP Networks (HBRMT)  Used only for Uncompressed Video transport  Defines a unidirectional IP-based protocol for the transport of real-time video, audio and ancillary signals  Particularly, the standard defines a method or encapsulation for the payloads of existing SD video signals  This standard pertains to uncompressed signals with rates of 270Bbits/s or higher.
