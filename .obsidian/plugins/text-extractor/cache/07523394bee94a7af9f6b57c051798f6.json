Whole window will be from 10PM to 12AM that evening, leaving most of the time for testing/faxing all the CRs/production areas. Video/Audio will not be impacted and only routing will be paused during this time. Estimating that the testing/fax will start around 11PM. Leo and Ofir, who from the teams can we work with during this window? TD and A1 to cover 31/32 and an operator to help test CR 74. Want to make sure we have CR 74 covered as well with a dedicated resource to check the room and Calrec. Evertz and router team will be remote during this time while and Maintenance will be assisting on the ground. Thanks, Trevor Bascomb NBCUniversal Manager, Production Systems Engineering","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
