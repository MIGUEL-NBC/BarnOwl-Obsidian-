Summary: Production EXE was experiencing an issue with intermittent Line card and/or Switch Fabric disconnects that are correlated back to various system wide hits and PTP blips. The solution to this problem was to upgrade firmware on the EXE to the latest release of firmware. Acquisition EXE system was upgraded on May 25 th without any issues. Production EXE system was upgraded on June 1 st. Post Production upgrade various control rooms began experiencing intermittent flashing or total loss of video on monitor walls. CR 31 and other shared service devices were mainly affected. Troubleshooting the issue showed that a power cycle of the frame was needed in order to allow the EXE to begin utilizing memory reallocations that were introduced in the latest build and was thought to have been causing the VIP source dropouts. Post reboot, the issue was still present, further investigation revealed that there is an incorrect default configuration of a packet queue threshold. Solution: The interim solution is to deploy a script that will set the proper queue threshold to the proper size. Any reboots of EXE I/O modules will result in the undoing of this setting change and the script will need to be redeployed, service team is aware of this unlikely scenario. Long term solution will be to release a new firmware version and deploy onsite. Investigation into when this queue threshold change was introduced is underway, further updates will be provided on this.
