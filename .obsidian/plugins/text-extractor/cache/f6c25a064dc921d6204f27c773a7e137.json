The approximately 2.07 million effective pixels image sensor technology for full HD resolution (1920 × 1080) and newly developed digital processing circuit enable the capture of very high-quality images, with a sensitivity of F12 (59.94i) / F13 (50i) and an SN ratio of 56 dB (w/o Noise Suppression (NS) mode). High-resolution pictures can be transmitted between the camera and camera control Unit (CCU) using Sony-developed digital transmission technology via multi-core cable. Multiple formats The camera supports 1080/59.94i, 720/59.94P, 1080/50i, and 720/50P formats. With its wide-range down-converter, the camera also enables output of high-quality SD signals (525i/ 625i) from the camera and the connected CCU. Using the HXCU-D70 and CCU-D50/D50P camera control units (CCU) The camera is compatible with the HXCU-D70 for HD/SD signal output, and CCU-D50/D50P for SD signal output. With HXCU-D70, HD/SD simultaneous output can be provided from both the camera and CCU. Newly designed integrated unit The camera comes with stylish and sophisticated appearance. It provides easy-to-use design for setting up a system with multi-core cables or for shooting with batteries on your shoulder. The CCZ-A connector on the camera enables you to connect it to the CCU using a single Sony multi-core cable. The interface follows the original design with more user- friendly features. Various picture adjustment functions Selection of multiple gamma tables Seven types of standard and 4 types of hypergamma tables are featured. The hypergamma values enable cinema-like image creations with wide dynamic range, which are different from those achieved with conventional video gamma. Knee saturation Change in hue and decrease in saturation that occur in highlighted areas can be compensated. This enables reproduction of natural skin tones under strong lighting. Low key saturation Saturation in low-key zones can be compensated. Skin-tone detail This function allows control (emphasis or suppression) of the detail level for just a certain hue or saturation area in the image, such as skin tones. Auto focus The 2/3-type auto focus lens (supplied with HXC-D70K) ensures high-quality shooting in all situations from wide angle to telephoto. Using the HXC-D70 HD Color Camera enables auto-focusing, which is especially useful for technically demanding HD shooting. Position-adjustable shoulder pad The position of the shoulder pad can be adjusted for stable shooting according to the build of the camera operator, the type of lens in use, or the shooting style. A low-repulsion shoulder pad (position fixed) is available as an option. (Part No.: A-8286-346-A) Assignable switches The camera has buttons on the side panel to which various functions can be assigned. You can activate your desired function, such as electronic color-temperature conversion and digital extender, instantly when shooting by assigning it to one of these buttons in advance. Auto lens aberration compensation The Auto Lens Aberration Compensation (ALAC) function automatically reduces chromatic aberration of magnification when a lens that supports auto aberration compensation is attached. For details on lenses supporting auto aberration compensation, contact your Sony dealer or a Sony service representative. Focus assist functions The VF (viewfinder) detail and focus assist indicator functions facilitate focusing. VF detail Various functions are provided for the VF detail signal, which can be added only on images on the viewfinder screen, in order to facilitate focusing, as follows: Coloring the VF detail signal Adding flicker to the VF detail signal by applying modulation Thickening the VF detail signal Automatically compensating for the VF detail level according to zoom position Focus assist indicator The focusing level indicator in the viewfinder provides a guide for focusing. The best focus setting can be easily determined by observing the level indicator as a guide. 7Features Chapter 1 Overview User selectable VF interfaces Two selectable interfaces - analog VF (20-pin, round) and digital VF (26-pin, rectangular) - allow for a versatile choice of viewfinders. Sony's newly developed 5-type color LCD viewfinders (DXF-C50WA) or existing CRT viewfinders, such as DXF-51 and DXF-20W, can be attached to the analog interface. Additionally, a digital interface is available for the 3.5-type color LCD VF CBK-VF01 (supplied with HXC-D70K/ HXC-D70L). “Memory Stick Duo” operation The camera is equipped with a “Memory Stick Duo” slot, which enables setup data storage and software upgrading using a “Memory Stick Duo.” System Configuration Peripherals and related devices for the camera are shown in figures.

Adjusting the Black Balance and the White Balance To ensure excellent image quality when using this camera, conditions may require that both the black balance and the white balance be adjusted. Black balance and white balance adjustment values that are automatically set by the camera and the various settings are stored in the camera memory and retained even when the power is turned off. Black balance adjustment The black balance will require adjustment in the following cases. • When the camera is used for the first time • When the camera has not been used for a long time • When the camera is used under conditions in which the surrounding temperature has changed greatly • When the GAIN selector (L/M/H) values have been changed by using OPERATION > SWITCH ASSIGN1 > GAIN switch in the setup menu (see page 57). It is not usually necessary to adjust the black balance when using the camera after it has been off. White balance adjustment Always readjust the white balance when the lighting conditions change. Adjusting the Black Balance In automatic black balance mode, adjustments are performed in the following order: black set and black balance. Manual black balance adjustment can be selected from the setup menu. For details of manual black balance adjustment, refer to the maintenance manual. 1 Set the OUTPUT/AUTO KNEE switch to CAM. 2 Push the WHT/BLK switch to BLK and release the switch. The message “Executing...” appears during execution, and changes to “OK” when the adjustment finishes. Adjustment values are saved to memory automatically. Notes • During the black balance adjustment, the iris is automatically closed. • During the black balance adjustment, the gain selection circuit is automatically activated so you may see flickering in the viewfinder, but this is not a fault. If automatic black balance adjustment cannot be made If the black balance adjustment cannot be completed normally, an error message will appear for about three seconds in the viewfinder. If any error message is displayed, retry the black balance adjustment. If the error message occurs again, consult your Sony dealer or a Sony service representative. Note If the lens cable is not firmly connected to the LENS connector, it may not be possible to adjust the lens iris. If this happens, the black balance will be incorrect. Adjusting the White Balance 1 Set the switches and selectors as shown below. • GAIN selector: L (set to a gain value that is as small as possible) • OUTPUT/AUTO KNEE switch: CAM • WHITE BAL switch: A or B 2 Set the FILTER knob to suit the lighting conditions as follows. 3 Place a white test card under the same lighting conditions as for the subject to be shot and zoom up to it. Alternatively, any white object such as a cloth or a wall can be used. The absolute minimum white area is as follows. Note Make sure there are not bright spots in the rectangle. Rectangle centered on the screen. The lengths of the sides are 70% of the length and width of the screen. The white object must be within the rectangle and have an area of at least 10% of the screen. 38 Adjustments and Settings Chapter 3 Shooting 4 Adjust the lens iris. Manually adjusted lens: set the iris to an appropriate setting. Lens with automatic iris: set the automatic/manual switch on the lens to automatic. 5 Push the WHT/BLK switch to WHT and then release the switch. The message “AWB: EXECUTING..” appears during execution, and changes to “AWB: OK” when the adjustment finishes. The adjustment values are saved automatically in the memory selected in step 1 (A or B). Note If the camera has a zoom lens with an automatic iris, the iris may hunt 1) during the adjustment. To prevent this, adjust the iris gain knob (indicated as IG, IS, or S) on the lens. For details, refer to the lens operation manual. 1) Hunting: Repeated brightening and darkening of the image, resulting from repeated response to automatic iris control. If the automatic white balance adjustment cannot be made If the white balance adjustment cannot be completed normally, an error message will appear for about three seconds in the viewfinder. If any error message is displayed, retry the white balance adjustment. If the error message occurs again, consult your Sony dealer or a Sony service representative. If you have no time to adjust the white balance Set the WHITE BAL switch to PRST. This makes it possible to automatically set the white balance to 5600K (factory default value) by pressing the COLOR TEMP. button. The color temperature to which the white balance is set when the COLOR TEMP. button is pressed can be selected from among 3200K, 4300K, 5600K, and 6300K in MAINTENANCE > WHITE FILTER > ELECTRICAL CC <A>/<B>/<C>/<D> in the setup menu (see page 67). To switch between electrical CC filters with an assignable switch You can assign the function that switches between electrical CC filters to an assignable switch. This allows you to switch between color temperatures (3200K/4300K/5600K/6300K) that have been assigned to up to four positions (A to D) with each press of the assignable switch. 1 Select MAINTENANCE > WHITE FILTER in the setup menu (see page 67). 2 Select the position to which to assign a CC filter by selecting one of [ELECTRICAL CC <A>] to [ELECTRICAL CC <D>], and then turn the menu control knob to select the desired color temperature. As you turn the menu control knob, the color temperature changes as follows: 3200K y 4300K y 5600K y 6300K. To set no color temperature Select “-----” with ELECTRICAL CC <C> or <D> selected. When the assignable switch is pressed, the setting for that position is not displayed. For example, if “-----” is set for one position, then switching between the remaining three positions is carried out. 3 Repeat step 2 as required. 4 Assign the electrical CC filter switching function (ELECTRICAL CC) to an assignable switch. For details, see OPERATION > SWITCH ASSIGN1 in the setup menu (page 57). White balance memory There are two white balance memories: A and B. When you execute automatic white balance adjustment, the adjusted white balance value and the setting of the filter select knob will be stored in either memory A or B, selected with the WHITE BAL switch. The white balance values stored in memory will be preserved even when power is turned off. When power is turned on again, the white balance in memory corresponding to the current WHITE BAL switch setting is retrieved. Setting the Electronic Shutter Note When a CCU or an external control device, such as an RCP/ RM, is connected, the electronic shutter is controlled from the external control device or CCU, and the switch on the camera is disabled. Shutter Modes The shutter modes that can be used with the electronic shutter and the shutter speeds that can be selected are listed below. Standard mode Select this mode for shooting fast-moving subjects with little blurring. Speed mode WHT/BLK switch 39Adjustments and Settings Chapter 3 Shooting ECS (Extended Clear Scan) mode Select this mode for obtaining images with no horizontal bands of noise when shooting subjects such as monitor screens. Range of shutter speeds that can be set varies as shown in the following tables. System lines: 1080 System lines: 720 Selecting the Shutter Mode and Shutter Speed Notes • When the automatic iris is used, the iris opens wider as the shutter speed increases, thus reducing the depth of field. • The selectable shutter speeds vary depending on the current system frequency. To set the shutter mode and standard-mode shutter speed Once the shutter speed is selected, it is retained even when the camera power is turned off. 1 Push the SHUTTER selector from ON to SEL. The current shutter setting indication appears in the viewfinder for about three seconds. Example: Shutter: 1/250 2 Before the shutter setting indication disappears, push the SHUTTER selector down to SEL again and repeat this until the desired mode or speed appears. When all modes and speeds are displayed, the display changes in the following order. To set the shutter speed in ECS mode 1 Set the shutter mode to ECS (see page 39). 2 Turn the menu control knob to select the desired frequency or number of frames. Changing the Reference Value for Automatic Iris Adjustment The reference value for automatic iris adjustment can be changed to aid the shooting of clear pictures of back-lit subjects, or to prevent blown-out highlights. The reference value for the lens iris can be set within the following range with respect to the standard value. • 0.25 to 1 (increasing by increments of 0.25): About 0.25 to 1 stop further open • –0.25 to –1 (decreasing by increments of 0.25): About 0.25 to 1 stop further close Also you can set the area where light detection occurs. To change the reference value 1 Set MAINTENANCE > AUTO IRIS > AUTO IRIS in the setup menu to ON (see page 64). 2 Change the reference value in MAINTENANCE > AUTO IRIS > OVERRIDE in the setup menu. Note Be sure to confirm that the current shutter mode is not ECS. An indicator of the current reference value is shown at the iris position indication (see page 17) in the viewfinder. To make the iris more open Turn the menu control knob clockwise as seen from the front of the camera. Select one of 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1. To stop down the iris Turn the menu control knob counterclockwise as seen from the front of the camera. Select one of –0.25, –0.5, –0.75, or –1. The changed reference value is retained until the power of the camera is turned off. Even if the reference value is changed, it reverts to the standard value every time the power is turned on. Zooming The lens supplied with the HXC-D70K allows you to shoot with manual and servo zooming. Switching between Zoom Modes Set the ZOOM switch to SERVO (servo zoom) or MANUAL (manual zoom). Using Manual Zoom With the ZOOM switch set to MANUAL, turn the zoom ring.

The current lens zoom position appears in the viewfinder, over the range 0 (wide-angle) to 99 (telephoto) (see page 17). Push to the W (wide) side when you want wide-angle, and push to the T (telephoto) side when you want telephoto. The zoom speed increases when you push the lever deeply, and decreases when you push less deeply. Adjusting the Focus The lens supplied with the HXC-D70K allows you to adjust the focus in the following three ways. Full MF (full manual focus) mode This mode supports focusing with the focus ring only. Without changing your grip, you can focus all the way from ∞ to the shortest shooting distance. MF (manual focus) mode In this mode, auto focus is enabled temporarily when you press the PUSH AF button. You can also use the MF * function (see page 40). AF (auto focus) mode In this mode, auto focus is always enabled. The focus ring and the PUSH AF button are also enabled. Note The lens is designed with an extra margin at the infinity position (∞), to compensate for focus drifting due to variations in temperature. When shooting a subject at infinity in MF or Full MF mode, check the picture in the viewfinder as you focus. Adjusting in Full MF Mode When you slide the focus ring back (toward the camera), the focus mode becomes Full MF mode, in which all focus adjustments are manual. Note When you slide the focus ring back, the focus instantly moves to the mark position. Focus by turning the focus ring while viewing the viewfinder. The distance indications on the ring are valid in Full MF mode. The distances where the picture is in focus correspond to absolute positions of the focus ring. Peaking You can turn the PEAKING knob on the viewfinder to use the peaking function. Edges are emphasized in the monitor picture, which facilitates manual focusing. The recorded video signals are not affected. Adjusting in MF Mode When you slide the focus ring forward (toward the lens hood), and set the FOCUS switch to M (manual), the focus mode becomes MF mode, in which focus adjustments are manual but auto focus is available only when necessary. Using the focus ring Focus by turning the focus ring while viewing the viewfinder. The distance indications on the ring are invalid in MF mode. One-push auto focus Press the PUSH AF button. Auto focus is enabled temporarily (one-push auto focus). One-push auto focus ends when the subject is brought into focus. MF * function When the MF * function is on, auto focus starts when you stop adjusting with the focus ring, enabling fine adjustments with the subject at the center of the screen. Auto focusing by the MF * function ends when the fine adjustments end. Adjusting in AF Mode When you slide the focus ring forward, and set the FOCUS switch to A (auto), the focus mode becomes AF mode, in which auto focus is always active. The distance indications on the ring are invalid in AF mode. Focusing in AF mode In AF mode, the camera monitors the video for changes, and starts auto focus whenever it detects a change. Auto focusing ends when the subject is in focus, but the auto focus function remains on standby. In AF mode, you can also start auto focusing by pressing the PUSH AF button or by turning the focus ring. Using Macro Mode When the focus mode is MF or AF, you can set the MACRO switch to the ON side to enable macro mode. Macro mode allows you to focus over the range that includes the macro area. Macro mode is disabled in Full MF mode.

Adding a VF detail signal Adding a VF detail signal to sharp edges in the image in the viewfinder makes it easier to check the focusing condition by observing changes in the detail signal or in the color converted from the detail signal (color detail). The focus setting where the detail signal becomes strongest is the best focus setting. 1 Set the DISPLAY/MENU switch to MENU while holding the menu control knob pressed. 2 Select OPERATION > VF DETAIL in the setup menu (see page 56). 3 Rotate the menu control knob to align the pointer to the item to be set and push on the knob. To use the VF detail signal Set VF DETAIL to ON to activate the VF detail function to add the detail signal to sharp edges in the image. You can adjust the signal level (strength) in the range of 0 to 100% (default 25%). You can adjust the characteristics of the detail signal with the menu items below: CRISP: Adjust to eliminate fine portions of the detail signal. FREQUENCY: Change the detection band of sharp edges. FAT MODE: Turn the function ON/OFF to thicken the detail signal. AREA: To limit the area where to display the detail signal. ZOOM LINK: Set the VF detail level at the full WIDE position. (The VF detail level changes according to the zoom position.) To use the color detail Set COLOR DETAIL to ON to convert the VF detail signal to a specified color. This makes it easier to check the signal on an LCD screen, including the viewfinder screen. The display color can be selected at the column next to ON. You can adjust the coloring with the menu items below: PEAK COLOR: Turn the function ON/OFF to change the color where the detail signal is strongest. CHROMA LEVEL: To reduce the chroma components of the video signal (only for video signals in the viewfinder). 4 Rotate the menu control knob to display the desired setting and push on the knob. 5 Set the DISPLAY/MENU switch to OFF to exit menu mode. Displaying the focus assist indicators The focus assist indicator function extracts the irregularities of a subject and converts the integrated values to a level indicator, which shows the focus condition. The focus setting where the indicator shows the maximum level is the best focus setting. (The range of the indicator substantially changes depending on picture elements or shooting environments. Adjust it with GAIN and OFFSET as required.) 1 Set the DISPLAY/MENU switch to MENU while holding the menu control knob pressed. 2 Select OPERATION > FOCUS ASSIST in the setup menu (see page 56). 3 Rotate the menu control knob to align the pointer to the item to be set and push on the knob. To use the level indicator Setting INDICATOR to ON displays the level indicator in the viewfinder. You can set the display format with the menu items below. MODE: Set the type and position of the indicator. LEVEL: Set the density and the response speed of the indicator. GAIN: Set the sensitivity of the indicator.1) OFFSET: Set the offset of the focus detection value.2) 1) Normally, the sensitivity of the indicator is automatically set to the optimum value in conjunction with the AREA MARKER SIZE set value. Use this setting when an optimum sensitivity value cannot be obtained, depending on the shooting environment. 2) Normally, the optimum offset is automatically set in conjunction with the AREA MARKER SIZE and MASTER GAIN set values. Use this setting when the optimum offset cannot be obtained, depending on the shooting environment. To use the area marker Setting AREA MARKER to ON displays the detection area of the focus as a marker in the viewfinder. You can set the size and position of the detection area with the menu items below. SIZE: The size of the detection area can be changed. (If the area size is too large, both the subject and the background are included in the area, making the indicator display easily deviate from the subject.) POSITION: Roughly set the position of the detection area. POSITION H: Finely adjust the position of the detection area in the horizontal directions. POSITION V: Finely adjust the position of the detection area in the vertical directions. 4 Rotate the menu control knob to display the desired setting and push on the knob. Level indicator (Its position and operations can be adjusted.)

Notes • The level indicator and the effect area marker cannot be displayed simultaneously, whichever you set to ON later is preferentially displayed. • The area marker and the aspect safety marker cannot be displayed simultaneously, whichever you set to ON later is preferentially displayed. • When displaying the focus assist indicators, check that the flange focal length has been precisely adjusted. See “Adjusting the Flange Focal Length” (page 30) for the flange focal length. Setting the Camera Outputs You can specify video signals directly output from the camera, with menu operations. Note The MAIN (camera picture), RET (return video), or VF (the same picture as that displayed in the viewfinder) setting is common to SD-SDI and VBS. Different signals cannot be output. The menu pages used for the output settings have been registered to the USER menu at the factory. • <POWER SAVE> (U10) • <OUTPUT FORMAT> (U15) • <TEST OUT> (U16) • <DOWN CONVERTER> (U17) Set the menu items on the above menu pages to the settings shown in the following tables. For details on menu operations and the USER menu, see “Basic Menu Operations” (page 48). Outputting the signal being shot (camera picture) The same textual information as that displayed in the viewfinder can be added to the output signal by setting CHARACTER to ON on the <SDI OUT> or <TEST OUT> page. To output as HD-SDI To output as SD-SDI To output as VBS Constantly outputting a return video • When a CCU is connected, one of the signals being supplied to the CCU can be output from the camera. • The last selected return signal is output. To output as HD-SDI Outputting the same image as that in the viewfinder With HD-SDI, you can obtain a signal that includes the same information as that being displayed in the viewfinder according to the settings for VF MARKER, CHARACTER, VF DETAIL, ZEBRA, etc. The ON/OFF or other settings for adding information are common to those for the viewfinder. The output is synchronized with switching among Y, R, G, and B or switching to a return signal. To output as HD-SDI To output as TEST OUT Note VF signal format (a Y signal only) output from the TEST OUT connector varies depending on which of the following viewfinders are connected to the VF connector (20-pin, round). No viewfinder: SD component (Y) signal DXF-C50WA viewfinder: HD component (Y) signal Viewfinders other than DXF-C50WA: SD component (Y) signal Outputting a prompter signal The VBS signal supplied to the PROMPTER connector of the CCU is output from the PROMPTER/GENLOCK connector of the camera. Adjusting the Audio Level When the camera is used with the HXCU-D70 The input levels from audio sources connected to the AUDIO 1 IN and AUDIO 2 IN connectors can be adjusted using a remote control panel connected to the CCU or the CONFIGURATION menu on the CCU. When the audio input select switch is set to MIC, the level can be adjusted between 20 dB and 60 dB in steps of 10 dB. When the audio input select switch is set to LINE, the level cannot be adjusted.

When the audio input select switch is set to MIC, the level can be adjusted between 20 dB and 60 dB in steps of 10 dB, using the INTERCOM LEVEL control. When the audio input select switch is set to LINE, the level cannot be adjusted. You can change the VR functions using OPERATION > VR ASSIGN in the setup menu (see page 57). Set the gain to avoid clipping the audio signal by monitoring the audio level meters and waveforms. Using the flash band compensation function Flash band artifacts are detected and compensated by using the flash band compensation function. Set MAINTENANCE > CIS COMP > FLASH BAND COMP (page 65) in the setup menu to on. • The flash band compensation function is available when the shutter function is deactivated. • The flash band compensation function will be forcibly switched from on to off while the shutter function is activated. The function turns on automatically after the shutter function becomes deactivated. Notes • While the flash band compensation function is set to on, video output from the camera is delayed by 1 field. • Depending on the shooting conditions, flash band artifacts may not be detected and compensated properly. The function may not be performed depending on the following conditions: – Subject of shooting – Ambient lighting – Camera-subject distance/angle – Flash-subject distance/angle – Flash intensity – Light-emitting time – Multiple-flash for a shooting – Timing to flash for a shooting • The flash band compensation function is activated when the brightness of the lower half of the image differs considerably from the upper half. Since the function may be inadvertently activated under certain shooting conditions, in which the brightness between the upper and lower half of the image differs markedly, be sure to use the function only for shooting footage exposed to flash light. To reduce flash band artifacts If flash band artifacts are detected using this function, the unit compensates them as follows. No compensation is performed when a flash extends to the entire screen (the brightness is not divided between the top and bottom of the image). When the flash band effects appears in two frames Stitches together the split-field flash frames, regenerating a single frame in which a flash extends entirely. Notes • The compensation is performed by reducing the brightness of flashes. • Horizontal lines (low brightness line of pixels) may appear on the screen as a result of regeneration of the frame. • When a moving subject is shot, images in the upper and lower parts of the screen may appear discontinuously or the subject may appear to be stationary for a moment. • The flash band effect remains uncorrected when a flash extends from the lower lines of pixels. Using the digital extender function With this function, the central area of the screen is magnified twice. 1 Sets MAINTENANCE > POWER SAVE > D.EXTENDER (page 67) in the setup menu to ENABLE. 2 Select DIGITAL EXTENDER in OPERATION > SWITCH ASSIGN1 > ASSIGNABLE1/2/3 (in either of three) in the setup menu (page 57). 3 Press the ASSIGNABLE button you assigned the function to in step 2. The central area of the screen is magnified twice. Pressing the button again returns to the standard display mode. Notes • While MAINTENANCE > POWER SAVE > D.EXTENDER (page 67) in the setup menu is set to ENABLE, video output from the camera is delayed by 1 field. • If both the flash band compensation function and digital extender function are used at the same time, video output from the camera is delayed by 2 fields.

If you shoot a scene that includes a laser beam, be careful not to let the laser beam be directed into the lens of the camera. Fitting the zoom lens It is important to fit the lens correctly, as otherwise damage may result. Be sure to refer to the section “Mounting and Adjusting the Lens” (page 29). Viewfinder Do not leave the camera with the eyepiece pointing directly at the sun. The eyepiece lens can concentrate the sun’s rays and melt the interior of the viewfinder. 75Using a “Memory Stick Duo” Appendix About the LCD panels LCD panels are manufactured with extremely high-precision technology that yields effective pixel rates of 99.99% or higher. However, very rarely, one or more pixels may be permanently dark or permanently lit in white, red, blue, or green. This phenomenon is not a malfunction. Such pixels have no effect on the recorded data, and the camera may be used with confidence even if they are present. Phenomena specific to CMOS image sensors The following phenomena that may appear in images are specific to CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) image sensors. They do not indicate malfunctions. White flecks Although the CMOS image sensors are produced with high- precision technologies, fine white flecks may be generated on the screen in rare cases, caused by cosmic rays, etc. This is related to the principle of CMOS image sensors and is not a malfunction. The white flecks especially tend to be seen in the following cases: • when operating at a high environmental temperature • when you have raised the master gain (sensitivity) The problem may be alleviated by executing automatic black balance adjustment. Aliasing When fine patterns, stripes, or lines are shot, they may appear jagged or flicker. Flicker If recording is made under lighting produced by discharge tubes, such as fluorescent, sodium, or mercury-vapor lamps, the screen may flicker, colors may vary, or horizontal stripes may appear distorted. In such cases, set the flicker-reduction function to auto mode (see page 65). If the frame rate selected for recording is close to the power- supply frequency, flicker may not be reduced sufficiently even if you activate the Flicker-Reduction function. In such cases, use the electronic shutter. Focal plane Owing to the characteristics of the pickup elements (CMOS image sensors) for reading video signals, subjects that quickly move across the screen may appear slightly skewed. Flash band The luminance at the top and bottom of the screen may change when shooting a flashlight beam or a light source that quickly flashes. Using a “Memory Stick Duo” You can use “Memory Stick Duo” media with the camera. When a “Memory Stick Duo” is inserted in the camera, the file data can be stored on the “Memory Stick Duo,” which enables you to share data among devices. The camera operations have been checked using “Memory Stick Duo” media up to 8GB. Note Only a “Memory Stick” of Duo size can be used with the camera. Inserting a “Memory Stick Duo” 1 Push the cover down, and 2 insert a “Memory Stick Duo” with the label side facing up into the slot until it clicks and the access lamp lights in red. When the “Memory Stick Duo” is properly set, the lamp lights in green. Note Be sure to insert a “Memory Stick Duo” in the right direction. If it does not fit into the slot properly or if there is some resistance when you insert it, the “Memory Stick Duo” may be turned around or upside-down. Do not force the “Memory Stick Duo” into the slot. Confirm the direction of the notch and arrow on the “Memory Stick Duo” before inserting the “Memory Stick Duo,” and then try inserting it again. Removing a “Memory Stick Duo” Confirm that the access lamp is not lit in red, then lightly push in the “Memory Stick Duo” to release the lock. Note If the access lamp is lit in red, data is being read from or written to the “Memory Stick Duo.” At this time, do not shake the product or subject it to shock. Do not turn off the power to the product or remove the “Memory Stick Duo.” Doing so may damage the data. Label side “Memory Stick Duo” 76 Exchanging the Battery of the Internal Clock Appendix Protecting saved data To prevent accidental erasure of important setup data, use the LOCK switch on the “Memory Stick Duo.” Slide the switch upward to the write protect position. This ensures that you cannot inadvertently overwrote data on the “Memory Stick Duo.” Note When using “Memory Stick Duo” media that does not have a LOCK switch, be careful not to inadvertently overwrite or erase your data. Precautions • Do not attach anything other than the supplied label to the “Memory Stick Duo” labeling position. • Attach the label so that it does not stick out beyond the labeling position. • Carry and store the “Memory Stick Duo” in its case. • Do not touch the connector of the “Memory Stick Duo” with anything, including your finger or metallic objects. • Do not strike, bend, or drop the “Memory Stick Duo.” • Do not disassemble or modify the “Memory Stick Duo.” • Do not allow the “Memory Stick Duo” to get wet. • Do not use or store the “Memory Stick Duo” in a location that is: – Extremely hot, such as in a car parked in the sun – Under direct sunlight – Very humid or subject to corrosive substances • To prevent data loss, make backups of data frequently. In no event will Sony be liable for any loss of data. • Unauthorized recording may be contrary to the provisions of copyright law. When you use a “Memory Stick Duo” that has been pre-recorded, be sure that the material has been recorded in accordance with copyright and other applicable laws. Exchanging the Battery of the Internal Clock The camera’s internal clock is powered by a lithium battery. If the message “BackUp Battery End” appears in the viewfinder, this battery must be exchanged.
