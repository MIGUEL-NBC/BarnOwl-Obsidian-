They incorporate the latest pickup elements and digital signal- processing LSI to yield higher picture quality and higher stability in image creation while maintaining conventional popular functions and operability. The differences among the models are shown below: Features High picture quality and high performance The new 2/3-type Progressive IT CCD for 2,200,000 pixels conforms to driving formats up to 1080/59.94P, achieving high sensitivity and low smear. In addition, the 14-bit A/D converter and a unique signal-processing LSI provide picture quality of optimal grade. Multiple formats The HDC1500R covers ten video formats, HDC1550R covers eight video formats, and HDC1400R and HDC1450R covers two video formats. With the HDC1500R, signal output of 1080/50P and 59.94P from the camera head is also possible via the Dual Link interface. Newly designed integrated unit with low center of gravity A stylish appearance with low-slung design has been adopted. When used in combination with the HDLA1500- series Large Lens Adaptor, it permits the viewfinder to be mounted at a low position, making the viewfinder position closer to the optical axis of the lens. Optimized handle shape and VF slide mechanism for stable shooting A new handle design has been adopted. A slight protrusion of the upper front part of the handle enables stable holding of the camera while you are shooting, by holding the front part of the handle. Furthermore, the movable range of a front-rear slide mechanism for the viewfinder attachment has been widened. Any difference in weight balance caused by having a different lens attached can be counteracted by adjusting the viewfinder attachment position, in combination with the movable shoulder pad position. This provides the best balance for shooting with the camera on your shoulder.

Position-adjustable shoulder pad The position of the shoulder pad can be adjusted for stable shooting according to the build of the camera operator, the type of lens in use, or the shooting style. A low-repulsion shoulder pad (position fixed) is available as an option (Part No.: A-8286-346-A). Function-assignable switches The camera has a switch to which various functions can be assigned on the side panel. You can activate your desired function, such as electronic color-temperature conversion, instantly when shooting by assigning it to the switch in advance. Switches on the handle are also available as function assignable switches. Auto Lens Aberration Compensation function The Auto Lens Aberration Compensation function (ALAC) is provided with this camera. This automatically reduces chromatic aberration of magnification when a lens that supports auto aberration compensation is attached. For details on lenses supporting auto aberration compensation, contact a Sony sales representative or Sony service representative. Focus assist functions The VF detail function and focus assist indicator function facilitate focusing. VF detail Various functions are provided for the VF detail signal, which can be added only on images on the viewfinder screen in order to facilitate focusing in various situations: Functions for coloring the VF detail signal, flickering the VF detail signal by adding modulation, thickening the VF detail signal, and automatically compensating the VF detail level according to the zoom position. Focus assist indicator The focusing level indicator on the viewfinder screen provides a guide for focusing. The best focus setting can be easily determined by observing fluctuation of the level indicator as a guide. “Memory Stick” 1) operation The camera is equipped with a “Memory Stick” port, which enables setup data storage and software upgrading using a “Memory Stick.” 1) Memory Stick and are trademarks of Sony Corporation. Various color-reproduction functions Selection of multiple gamma tables Seven types of standard and 4 types of hyper gamma tables are provided with this camera. The hyper gamma values enable cinemalike image creations with wide dynamic range, which are different from those achieved with conventional video gamma. HZC-UG444 User Gamma Application Software Installing the HZC-UG444 User Gamma Application Software enables the camera to support CvpFileEditor TM and RGB4:4:4 outputs (HDC1500R only). For details, refer to the HZC-UG444 Operation Manual. Multimatrix color correction In addition the standard 6-axis matrix function, the camera has a multimatrix function that permits you to adjust the hue and chroma for color components in 16-axis directions independently. This is quite useful in color matching among multiple cameras. Knee saturation Change of hue and decrease in chroma that occur in highlighted areas can be compensated. This enables reproduction of natural skin tones under strong lighting. Low key saturation Hue and saturation in low-key zones can be compensated. Thus, compensation for color reproduction in all zones is enabled in combination with matrix color compensation and knee saturation functions. Versatile detail control functions Skin-tone detail function This function allows control (emphasis or suppression) of the detail level for just a certain hue or chroma area in the image, by creating a detail gate signal from color components of your specified hue, such as skin tones. The detail levels of three hues can be adjusted independently at the same time. 7Overview Detail boost-frequency control The boost frequency can be adjusted from 20 to 30 MHz. This allows the detail thickness to be set appropriately for the subject, thus enabling more subtle image expression. H/V ratio control The ratio between horizontal and vertical detail can be adjusted. White/black limiter The white and black details can be limited independently. Easy menu-based setting Selections and settings for viewfinder display items, safety-zone marker 2) or center marker,3) screen size marker, etc. can be made quickly and easily, using setup menus displayed on the viewfinder screen or an external monitor. 2) Safety zone marker: A box-shaped marker displayed on the viewfinder screen which indicates 80%, 90%, 92.5%, or 95% of the total screen area 3) Center marker: A cross-shaped marker which indicates the center of the viewfinder screen Wide variety of viewfinder display options Along with items such as operation messages, a zebra pattern,4) a safety-zone marker, and a center marker, camera settings may also be displayed on the viewfinder screen. Furthermore, there are other indicators arranged above and below the viewfinder, such as a tally lamp, battery warning indicator, and an indicator to tell you that one or more settings are other than standard. This makes it simple to check the status of the camera. 4) Zebra pattern: A stripe pattern displayed on the viewfinder screen which indicates the portions where the video level is above about 70% or 100%. Used to check the video level of the subject. Optical digital transmission (HDC1500R/ 1400R) The camera uses electro-optical coding cable for 1.5- gigabit digital optical transmission between the camera and a Camera Control Unit.

The camera has no built-in condensation indicator. If you find condensation on the body or lens, switch the camera off and wait for the condensation to disappear for about one hour. Phenomena Specific to CCD Image Sensors The following phenomena that may appear in images are specific to CCD (Charge Coupled Device) image sensors. They do not indicate malfunctions. White flecks Although the CCD image sensors are produced with high- precision technologies, fine white flecks may be generated on the screen in rare cases, caused by cosmic rays. This is related to the principle of CCD image sensors and is not a malfunction. The white flecks especially tend to be seen • when operating at a high environmental temperature • when you have raised the master gain (sensitivity) This product has a compensation function and the problem may be alleviated by automatic black balance adjustment (see page 26). Smear When an extremely bright object, such as a strong spotlight or flashlight, is being shot, vertical tails may be produced on the screen, or the image may be distorted. Aliasing When fine patterns, stripes, or lines are shot, they may appear jagged or flicker. 12 Locations and Functions of Parts Locations and Functions of Parts Accessory Attachments a VF (viewfinder) connector (20-pin) Connect the cable of the viewfinder (not supplied). b Shoulder strap fitting post Attach one end of a shoulder strap (not supplied) to this fitting post, and the other end to the fitting post on the other side of the camera. c Accessory shoe To attach an accessory using a 1/4-inch screw. d Viewfinder left-right positioning ring Loosen this ring to adjust the viewfinder position towards the left or right. e Viewfinder front-rear positioning lever and lock knob Loosen the lever and knob to adjust the viewfinder position towards the front or rear.

Setting the Electronic Shutter This section explains the different modes which can be used for the electronic shutter and gives the procedures for setting the shutter mode and shutter speed. When a camera control unit or a remote control device, such as MSU-900/950 Master Setup Unit and RCP-700/ 900-series Remote Control Panel, is connected, the electronic shutter is controlled from the external control device and control on the camera are disabled. About the shutter modes The shutter modes that can be used with the electronic shutter of the camera and the shutter speeds that may be selected are as follows: 1) The values in the table are those with 59.94i. With other formats, the available values may be different. With artificial lighting, particularly fluorescent lights and mercury vapor lamps, the brightness appears to be constant, but in fact the strength of the red, green, and blue components varies with the power supply frequency. This phenomenon is known as “flicker.” When using the electronic shutter under these lighting conditions, there are certain cases in which the flicker is more noticeable. In particular, color flicker is evident when the power frequency is 60 Hz. In areas where the power frequency is 50 Hz, setting the shutter speed to 1/100 second will reduce the flicker. Selecting the shutter mode and speed The shutter mode, and the shutter speed in standard mode, are set using the SHUTTER switch. Note AUTO W/B BAL switch AWB:OK Note Shutter modes and speeds Shutter mode Shutter speeds 1) Usage Standard 1/100, 1/125, 1/250, 1/500, 1/1000, 1/2000 seconds Use to obtain clear images of quickly moving subjects ECS (Extended Clear Scan) Continuously variable in the range of 60.00 Hz to 4300 Hz Use to obtain images on video monitors without horizontal striping Note 29Adjustments and Settings for Shooting Setting the shutter mode, and shutter speed in Standard mode 1 Push the SHUTTER switch from the ON position to the SEL position.
