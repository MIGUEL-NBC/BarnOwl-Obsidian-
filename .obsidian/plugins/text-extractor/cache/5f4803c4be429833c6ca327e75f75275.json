Some USP Key functions are built to fire BOTH Oxtel macros and GPOs (E.G. Bug In) The general idea here is the minimize the extent to which the DNF/GTP-32 needs to be programmed with some intelligence or logic about what these functions actually do. Some of that is unavoidable for ease of operation – Notably, USP key functions and button labels. For the most part, we want DNF to act strictly as a translator for numbered inputs and outputs, and configure the purpose and meaning of those numbered functions on the receiving device. This document is meant to serve as a high-level guide to the control logic for Viz and ImageStores, not a complete DNF configuration reference. Why PBUS and USP Buttons? This gives operators the flexibility to control these functions either from a manual key press or via switcher effect timelines.

Chyron CG2 feeds CG2 distribution directly. “MSNBC” salvo will route Chyron Ch1 directly to CG1 distribution and bypass the Viz passthrough. This is the failover option for problems with the Viz engine, and is usable on air with “one line” ticker. For 8/15 Launch, CG1 on air will be Chyron passing through VizRT for DVE manipulation This is meant to accommodate moving Banner graphics on screen to accommodate Two-Line Tickers To accomplish this, we feed Chyron Ch1 to the Graphics router, via the local CR Cutover Router, and route it to the VizRT input. VizRT output passes back through GFX and Cutover Routers to CG1 distribution in the CR","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
