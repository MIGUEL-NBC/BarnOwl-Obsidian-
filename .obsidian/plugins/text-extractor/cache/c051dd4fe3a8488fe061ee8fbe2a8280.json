The 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE is conceptually organized as 6 WAN-side ports + 6 LAN-side ports, with a packet processing core between each WAN-LAN pair. A given processing core can sustain up to 256 data ﬂ ows, conﬁ gurable based on multicasts or VLAN Tags. This gives an exceptional product density of 12 x10GE ports, with 1536 multicast/VLAN ﬂ ows – All in the space-efﬁ cient Evertz 7800 modular hardware platform. Multiple processing cores can be conﬁ gured to aggregate their Tx trafﬁ c to a single WAN Port. Correspondingly, Rx trafﬁ c from that WAN port is distributed to its contributing processing cores. WAN-side Port Aggregation allows network engineers to achieve functions such as port-based redundancy using the 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE. The 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE is controlled by the industry-leading VistaLINK Pro, and via web interface. The 12 Ethernet ports can be a mixture of GigE or 10GE, simply by populating the desired SFP, offering full ﬂ exibility for LAN & WAN interfacing. The 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE2 provides four modes of operation: • The One-to-One NAT Mode allows unicast/multicast IP streams from one network to be translated to different unicast/multicast IP addresses, on a ﬂ ow-by-ﬂ ow basis, up to 256 unique ﬂ ows per processing core. Address translation is available in both directions, while an optional Packet Replication feature is provided in the WAN-to-LAN direction. • The Tunneling (or Encapsulation or MC-in-MC) NAT Mode allows unicast/ multicast addresses from the LAN side to be encapsulated into new multicasts for the WAN network, again, on a ﬂ ow-by-ﬂ ow basis, up to 128 unique settings per processing core. Correspondingly, trafﬁ c is de- encapsulated in the WAN-to-LAN direction. • The VLAN Mode allows VLAN-tagged datagrams from the LAN side to seamlessly enter a WAN after multicast encapsulation, similar to the Tunneling NAT mode. In this mode, however, ﬂ ows are based on VLAN Tags, rather than unicasts/multicasts alone. Up to 256 unique ﬂ ows can be conﬁ gured per processing core, with independent encapsulation headers. • The Port Mode allows the user to encapsulate all incoming LAN trafﬁ c on a given physical port, on a port-by-port basis. There is no multicast or VLAN Tag ﬁ ltering – All trafﬁ c on that physical LAN port is encapsulated out to the WAN, and de-encapsulated in the reverse direction. This mode provides a Bandwidth Capping feature such that network operators can ensure that links do not over-subscribe their contribution limits to a WAN. 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE CONTROLSFP+ 11SFP+ 5SFP+ 10SFP+ 3SFP+ 12SFP+ 6SFP+ 7SFP+ 2SFP+ 9SFP+ 4SFP+ 8SFP+ 1 Packet Processing Core (6x Cores in Product) IP NAT Mode MC-in-MC NAT &VLAN & Port Modes Packet Replication (Optional) Network Address Translation (Optional) De-Encap WAN RX 10GE Port - WAN Side WAN TX LAN TX 10GE Port - LAN Side LAN RX Network Address Translation (Optional) Encap (MC-in-MC mode only) Packet Accumulation (Port Mode Only, Optional) Encap Bandwidth Capping (Port Mode Only, Optional) WAN-to-LAN or “De-Encap” Direction LAN-to-WAN or “Encap” Direction IP NAT & MC-in-MC NAT Modes VLAN/Port Modes IP NAT Mode MC-in-MC NAT &VLAN & Port Modes IP NAT & MC-in-MC NAT Modes VLAN/Port Modes 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE2 High Density Network Address Translator and Data Encapsulator Rev. 16-1 Speciﬁ cations One-to-One NAT: 1536 x static mapping Packet Replication (WAN-to-LAN direction) VLAN ID change Ingress trafﬁ c ﬁ ltering based on VLAND ID option MC-in-MC NAT: 1536 x Multicast Mapping VLAN based NAT: 1536 x VLAN ID Mapping Port based NAT: 12 x datagram ﬂ ow mapping (from 12 x 1/10GE) Virtual Interfaces: 15x Interfaces per data port (both WAN and LAN side) VLAN ID change (One-to-One NAT mode) SFP Modules: 12 x SFP Modules • 1G copper RJ-45 (+SFPTR-RJ45-SER-AV) • 10/100/1G optical 1310nm (+SFPT1G-R13) • 10GE optical 850nm, MMF ( +SFP10G-TR85-A) • 10GE optical 1310nm, SMF, 2Km ( +SFP10G-TR13S) • 10GE optical 1310nm, SMF, 10Km ( +SFP10G-TR13-A) • 10GE optical 1550nm, SMF, 40Km ( +SFP10G-TR15S) • 10GE optical 1550nm, SMF, 80Km ( +SFP10G-TR15H) • 10GE optical CWDM (SFP10G-TRCxxH) and DWDM (SFP10G-TRDxxxH) 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE2 High Density NAT Enclosures 7800FR 3RU Multiframe which holds up to 15 modules 7800FR-QT 3RU Multiframe which holds up to 15 modules 7801FR 1RU Multiframe which holds up to 4 modules 3700FR 6RU ATP multiframe which holds up to 15 modules Ordering Information WAN1 WAN WAN LAN LAN LANNAT CoreNAT Core NAT Core NAT Core NAT Core NAT Core NAT Core NAT Core NAT Core A D A D A D 3 5 7 9 11 2 4 6 8 10 12 WAN LAN Data Port Number Data Port Number ... ... 7880IPG-NAT-6-10GE2 High Density Network Address Translator and Data Encapsulator","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
