USP3-KEYSERVER DESCRIPTION The USP3-Keyserver is designed to be controlled by a 3rd party. Its Keyserver Control Protocol provides complete control over the Universal Switch Panel configuration and operation. The USP3 is configured as the server and the 3rd party is configured as the client. The configuration and operation associated with the standard USP have removed. Also, most of the configuration web pages associated with the standard USP have been removed. The USP3 will accept a maximum of two TCP/IP connections and 2 HTTP connections. The USP3 will supports only 100base-T speeds. The client is be responsible for initiating a connection to the USP3 and reconnecting, in the event of a loss of connection. Each LCD keyswitch may be remotely configured with text and tally color. In the case of two clients connected to one USP3, all key presses will be directed to the client that configured the switch. In the event that two clients configure the same switch, the last received configuration command will determine the switch’s configuration. When multiple clients are connected to the USP3, both may attempt to control the same keys causing intermittent operation from the client’s point of view. To prevent this from happening the following rules have been implemented: The Client connected to Port 23 may control Keys 1 - 8 at all time. If no Client is connected to Port 24, the Port 23 Client may control Keys 1 – 16. The Client connected to Port 24 may only control Keys 8 – 16 regardless of the Port 23 connection status. Please refer to the Keyserver Control Protocol documentation for detailed control information. USP3-KEYSERVER User Manual 3 OF 12 2.
