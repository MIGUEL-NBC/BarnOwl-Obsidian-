Technical Manual F.01U.304.914 Rev. 04 CHAPTER 1 Introduction The KP-4016/5032 series keypanels deliver superior high-quality digital audio using OMNEO technology from Bosch with Dante audio over IP via either copper or fiber. The KP-4016/5032 series keypanels delivers audio, free of noise, delay, and other artifacts present in legacy technology. This family of keypanels includes a rich set of connectors as standard, including GPIO (General Purpose Input and Output) and RC (Rear Connector) kit. As with other RTS products, emphasis is placed on backward compatibility with previous generations of matrices including analog technology. The KP-4016/5032 series utilizes the latest generation of wide angle TFT displays providing superior clarity, resolution, and longer display life delivering high-quality readability under a variety of lighting conditions. Optionally, there are two (2) packages (Control and Audio) with additional features and functions, such as voice message, real- time control, keypanel mirroring, etc. For more information on these packages, see “Audio and Control Packages” on page 293. Features • Superior digital, high-quality audio over IP (Internet Protocol) included through OMNEO technology, the branded IP- based solution from Bosch. • Advanced signal processing, delivering an audio experience, free of noise, echo, delay and other artifacts present in legacy technology. • Backward compatible with legacy technologies, such as analog audio in USOC and 568-B formats. • All previous optional hardware connectors (RC, GPI, etc) are now standard. • New wide-angle high-definition display. • Enhanced keypanel menus optimized for ease of use. • Front panel headset connector is field-swappable, making it simple to change the default 6-pin XLR headset connector with either a 5-pin XLR or 4-pin XLR headset connector without opening the unit, as needed. • For an additional price each, an Audio and/or Control add-on package is available for the KP-4016/5032, to greatly expand your keypanel and intercom system experience and capabilities.

Voice Messaging (Audio Package Only) IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading the KP-4016/5032 from version 1.1.1 or earlier to version 1.2.0 or later, you must do the following: • Download the Firmware • Download the License, if purchased. • Download the Voice Mail Chimes (downloaded with vm-chimes.mot) • Download the Voice Mail Icons (downloaded vm-icons.mot) For more information on downloading firmware, see “Download Firmware to the KP-5032/4016 From AZedit” on page 159. Take note, the VM chimes and VM icons are .mot files ad should be treated as firmware downloads, not Chimes or Icons. Panels shipped from the factory with v1.2.0 or higher, include VM Chimes and VM icons. VM (Voice Messaging) allows a caller to leave an audio message at a keypanel where the keypanel user has stepped away from or is currently busy and cannot answer a call. There are two (2) modes of voice messaging; AFK and Auto-Record. AFK (Away From Keypanel) mode indicates the keypanel user is not available or is away from the keypanel. AFK enables callers to leave a message for the user to listen to upon return to their keypanel. Auto-Record mode indicates the last 30 seconds of audio is always being recorded. When Auto-Record is active it does not matter if AFK is enabled or not, the keypanel constantly records the last 30 seconds of audio. On the keypanel in which Auto- Record is enabled, the record icon appears in the keypanel display window (see “Voice Messaging Icons” on page 68). Unlike AFK, where the recording icon is flashing while a message is being recorded, the icon is constant. 68 Basic Operation KP-4016/5032 Series Bosch Security Systems, Inc.

Tally Icon Descriptions Icon Icon Name Description 92 Basic Operation KP-4016/5032 Series Bosch Security Systems, Inc. Technical Manual F.01U.304.914 Rev. 04 Panel Tally Panel Tally is used to notify a keypanel user of an event not specifically belonging to a key; for example, a blinking icon appears when a newscast is on air. Panel tallies are controlled through the use of UPL statements. Multiple UPL statements can be configured, but only one (1) icon displays at a time. Lower numbered icons take priority. NOTE: The keypanel ships with these icons built-in by default. However, you can download new icons to the panel using AZedit. Available panel tally icons are: Suggested Use Suggested Use Alarm, Appointment, Event Favorite Alarm, Chime, Notify Information Target, Incoming Negative Appointment, Event On Air On-Air, Live Warning, Alarm, Alert Error Sports Warning Alarm, Chime, Notify Positive, Notify Good, Affirmative KP-4016/5032 Series Basic Operation 93 Bosch Security Systems, Technical Manual F.01U.304.914 Rev. 04 Create and Download New Icons IMPORTANT: AZedit 5.2.0 and later include the panel and key icon files. Key Overlay Icons An Overlay Icon is an icon that lies on top of a key in the keypanel display screen of the keypanel. There are 32 icons shipped with the keypanel and supported. However, you can create your own icons. A single icon is 16 x 16 pixels. AZedit uses bitmaps rather than icon (.ico) files. This is so users can use the system tool Paint to create their icons, instead of a specialized icon editor. 32 icons are supported for key overlays, so the bitmap must be 512 pixels wide (16 pixels x 32 icons). Animation of icons is also supported (4 frames), so the bitmap is 64 pixels tall (16 pixel icons x 4 rows of icons), where each column of icons contains four (4) images for animation of the icon, and each row of icons represent stage 1–4 of the animation for each icon.Figure 29, shows a 512x64 pixel bitmap (a table of 32x4 icons). IMPORTANT: The following icons are built into the panel. The file is shipped with AZedit so it can be easily copied and modified by the user to create their own icons. By downloading you own icons, you are replacing the ones built into the keypanel. Retain a copy of the icons shipped with AZedit, in case you want to reuse the default icons. AZedit accepts a bitmap of narrower width (as long as it is a multiple of 16). This is done by extending the bitmap to 512 pixels by adding white space horizontally. Vertically, the bitmap needs to be 16 pixels high, and then repeat the image 3 more times to make it 64 pixels high. Repeating the icon four times, indicates there is no animation. You can also create a bitmap 32 pixels high (two (2) frames per icon) and repeat the image once to make 64 pixels high (so there would be two frames of animation repeated). FIGURE 29. 512 x 64 pixel bitmap of key overlay icons 94 Basic Operation KP-4016/5032 Series Bosch Security Systems, Inc. Technical Manual F.01U.304.914 Rev. 04 Panel Icons For Panel Icons, the icons are 32x32 pixels. 16 panel icons are supported, as well as 4-frame animation, so the bitmap must be 512x128, producing a table of 16x4 icons (each icon 32x32 pixels), see Figure 30. Like key icons, AZedit accepts a narrower image (as long as it is a multiple of 32) and uses white space to fill in the missing pixels. Shorter images are supported (as long as the image is either 32 or 64 pixels tall) and are replicated (3 times, or once) to get an image measuring 128 pixels tall. IMPORTANT: The following icons are built into the panel. The file is shipped with AZedit so it can be easily copied and modified by the user to create their own icons. By downloading you own icons, you are replacing the ones built into the keypanel. Retain a copy of the icons shipped with AZedit, in case you want to reuse the default icons FIGURE 30. 512 x 128 pixel bitmap of panel icons KP-4016/5032 Series Basic Operation 95 Bosch Security Systems, Technical Manual F.01U.304.914 Rev. 04 Keypanel Mirroring (Control Package Only) Keypanel Mirroring allows a licensed KP-5032/4016 keypanel (licensed as a supervisor) to take control of a target keypanel. All KP-Series keypanels can be the target of mirroring, whereas only licensed keypanels can be the supervisor of a target keypanel. By default, Keypanel Mirroring is disabled. You must enable a panel to be a mirror supervisor in AZedit. This allows any licensed keypanel to initiate a mirroring operation on a local target. IMPORTANT: Mirroring is not supported across trunks Keypanel Mirroring operates in real-time, meaning when a supervisor keypanel initiates a mirroring operation almost all aspects of the target keypanel functionality are accessible. Once the configuration file is transferred from the target to the supervisor keypanel, the supervisor keypanel looks and behaves like the target. Turning keys on/off, adjusting key volumes or panel volumes on either the target or supervisor keypanel is seen immediately on the other keypanel. NOTE: If a KP-5032 mirrors a KP-4016 or a DKP-4016, it does not take on the 1RU or desktop aspects. On the target keypanel, the keypad is locked out, preventing the target keypanel from entering the menu. Any changes to the configuration made by the supervisor keypanel are immediately transferred to the target keypanel. IMPORTANT: The Supervisor keypanel can change settings for features the Target is licensed for, even if the Supervisor is not licensed. Compression ratios, additional noise gate settings, and the 5-band equalizer settings are all available in the Supervisor (even if it is not licensed for these features) as long as the Target panel is licensed for them. For example, if the target keypanel supports a 5-band EQ and the supervisor keypanel does not, the supervisor keypanel is able to change the EQ settings. In AZedit, if a keypanel is a mirror Supervisor or Target, an icon is shown in the Port Status area in the Keypanel View. IMPORTANT: If you make changes, including real time changes, to a Target Keypanel using AZedit, those changes are also seen on the Supervisor Keypanel. However, if you make changes, including real-time changes, to a Supervisor Keypanel using AZedit, those changes are made to the Supervisor’s saved configuration, but are not implemented until the Supervisor Keypanel exits Mirroring and returns to normal operation. Supervisor icon The Supervisor icon signifies the keypanel is mirroring another keypanel and can make changes to the other keypanel, known as a Target. For more information, see “Service Menu, Mirror (Control Package Only)” on page 242. Target icon The Target icon signifies the keypanel is being mirrored by another keypanel, known as a Supervisor. This keypanel is being remotely controlled by the Supervisor. For more information, see “Service Menu, Mirror (Control Package Only)” on page 242. ****These icons appear on the keypanels involved in the mirror operation. 96 Basic Operation KP-4016/5032 Series Bosch Security Systems, Inc.

Key Options Menu, Panel Swap Panel Swap gives users the ability to quickly and easily change a group of keypanel assignments on the keypanel. This is done through the use of virtual expansion panels. Panel swap differs from changing setup pages because the keys can stay active even when they are no longer visible on the main panel. Also, panel swap allows the user a 1-touch trigger to complete two (2) actions at once. IMPORTANT: The number of actual physical keys on the keypanel and any attached actual physical expansion panel must be less than the numbers of keys per port supported by the intercom. For example, the KP-5032 has 32 physical keys and the matrix supports 64 keys per port; therefore, two (2) virtual EKP can be used (since each EKP adds 16 physical keys to the keypanel). However, a KP-5032 with two (2) EKP-4016s already has 64 physical keys, so virtual EKPs cannot be used unless the Intercom is configured for 96 or 128 ports. Panel swap can be activated by (or triggered by) a UPG key, a GPI Input, or GPI Output allowing local or remote access. A GPI board does not need to be installed to be controlled by GPI Outputs. However you must set up a Setup Page in AZedit for the virtual EKP to be able to assign key assignments. KP-4016/5032 Series KP-4016/5032 Menu System 225 Bosch Security Systems, Inc.
