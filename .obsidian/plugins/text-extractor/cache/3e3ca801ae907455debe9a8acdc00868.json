Stream I/O Devices (shared between ACR / FOH arbitration via HOME only!) Solution A W e still use mxGUI as a front-end for the 3rd party workstations. Each of these mxGUIs has an A__UHD Core V irtual Mixer as a routing/labeling back-end. Additional hardware required: 2 * A__UHD Core incl. appropriate SFPs 1 * Dell R340 Upgrade from HOME AP/MCX License to HOME Enterprise License Drawbacks: 2 Level Routing - route Senders and Receivers in HOME, route inside mxGUI. Blocking Routing only - if a resource is made available to one of the W orkstations it cannot be easily taken over by another , but only by going to HOME. Central Label management and propagation not possible - labels have to be set individually per mxGUI W orkstation (this can be mitigated by using a TCL script that can import labels from a csv file). No god-mode mxGUI possible anymore - routing has to be overseen in HOME and individual mxGUIs. 1* 64 Ch.

This router has been used to build a DSN system, to provide rights management not only for the two Mix rooms, but also 5 additional workstations, where audio routing and mic preamp control was required for 3rd party audio workstations or mixing consoles (FOH, ACR, Monitors/FB, SFX). T o provide audio routing (incl. custom labeling) and mic preamp control at these workstations, an mxGUI was installed. During the pre-sales phase of this project, these workstations have not suf ficiently been looked at, however this are still an important requirement for the acceptance from NBC. While the customer would accept a combination of V isTool for Mic Preamp control and HOME for routing, the disability to define user labels for signals in HOME makes this unapplicable NBC SNL 8H Renewal Author: Lucas Zwicker Doug Smith Content: Overview Date: 2022-08-25 2022-10-06 V ersion: 1.3 MAIN/RDNT MADI HOME CLUSTER / XCS FOR CONSOLES SER VER-1 HOME 1 1A 4B 5B SER VER-2 HOME 2 2A 1B 6B SER VER-3 HOME 3 3A 2B 7b SER VER-4 5a 6A 3B 4A SER VER-5 7a 8 1A/1B MIX8H-1 2A/2B MIX8H-2 3A/3B FOH (DIGICO) 4A/4B FB-2 5A/5B FB-1 (SSL 500) 6A/6B ACR (CALREC) 7A/7B MIX 1A 8 R TR UTIL 1* 64 Ch.
