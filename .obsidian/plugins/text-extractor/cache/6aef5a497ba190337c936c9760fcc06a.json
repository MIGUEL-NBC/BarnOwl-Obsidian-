The applicable cameras and camera control units are shown in the table below. 1) Only HDCU1000 units of serial number 14001 or higher (UC), 44001 or higher (CE), or 410001 or higher (CE) are applicable. Installing these units provides conventional HD color camera and HD camera control units for HD-SDI optical transmission with “High Bit Rate” optical transmission capability. The bit rate (High Bit Rate/HD-SDI) of optical transmission between the camera and the camera control unit is automatically switched, depending on connected devices. The HKCU2005 3G Single Link Interface Unit is a function enhancement unit for the HDCU1000 with an HKCU-HB10 installed and the HDCU1500 with an HKCU-HB15 installed. When an HKCU2005 is installed, max. four 3G-SDI signal outputs can be fed from the camera control unit. If these products are installed incorrectly, personal injury or damage to peripheral items may occur due to fire, shock, or other accidental circumstances. To avoid such risks, installation should be performed by trained service technicians. About the manuals This operation manual introduces the outlines of systems which can be established by installing the above- mentioned products in a camera or camera control unit, and it describes the functions added or changed by the function enhancement. For conventional functions and operations of the camera or camera control unit, refer to the operation manual supplied with the camera or camera control unit. Camera Systems That Become Available The following camera systems become available with the 3G Fiber Transmission Units. (There are some restrictions, depending on the model and combination of the products. See the table “Additional Functions” in the next paragraph.) • Fiber transmission system of Dual Link1) or Single Link2) format (signal transmission at “High Bit Rate”) • COAXIAL connection system of Single Link format using two coaxial cables • Dual-Camera system • Sub-Camera system (Only HDCU1000 with an HKCU- HB10 installed can be the main camera control unit.) HDC1000R/1500R/1000/1500-series models with no 3G Fiber Transmission Unit installed can be used in combination. For connections and settings, see “Connections and Settings” (page 23). 1) Dual Link formats: 1080/59.94P, 1080/50P 2) Single Link formats: 1080/59.94I, 1080/29.97PsF, 1080/23.98PsF, 720/59.94P, 1080/50I, 1080/25PsF, 1080/24PsF, 720/50P Notes • Connection compatibility with HDC-900-series models is lost by function enhancement. • Do not install the 3G Fiber Transmission Units in any cameras or camera control units other than the applicable models.

It is designed to be installed in slot 2 of an HDCU1000 with an HKCU-HB10 installed or that of HDCU1500 with an HKCU-HB15 installed. When the HKCU2005 is installed, max. four 3G-SDI signal outputs can be fed from the HDCU1000/1500. A signal of 1080P format transmitted from a camera and a converted signal of 720P format can be output simultaneously. The format of SDI signal output from the HIF-57 board can be specified independently for the two upper connectors and two lower connectors. • Always install the HKCU2005 in slot 2 of a camera control unit with an HKCU-HB10/HB15 installed. • Do not install two or more HKCU2005 unit in the same camera control unit. DRX-8 Board a Output signal format indicators Displays the format status of the output signal. 1080/720/SD: One of these indicators corresponding to the signal status of output connectors 1 and 2 of the four SDI signal outputs from this unit lights. P/PsF: Lights when the video camera is operating in Progressive mode. FC/RC: Lights when the frame rate converter/rate converter function of the unit is performed. 60/50/30/25/24: One of these indicators corresponding to the field/frame frequency of the output signals lights. HIF-57 Board a 3G-SDI OUT (3G/HD serial digital interface output) 1-4 connectors (BNC-type) Four 3G-SDI or HD-SDI signals as well as two 3G-SDI and two HD-SDI signals can be output.
