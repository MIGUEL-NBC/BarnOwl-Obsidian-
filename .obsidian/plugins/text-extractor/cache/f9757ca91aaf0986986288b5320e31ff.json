Same as the upgrade we did last week on ACQ, this upgrade was done to fully resolve an outstanding EXE Frame Controller software bug, which was related to the November 16th Outage that we had across the IP Control Rooms. Please be aware of any odd reports from the CRs and Operations, let us know if anything pops up. Trevor Bascomb NBCUniversal Manager, Production Systems Engineering","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
