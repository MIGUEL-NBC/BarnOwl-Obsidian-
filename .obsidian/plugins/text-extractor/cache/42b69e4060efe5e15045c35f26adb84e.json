{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Studio Maintenance - Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Augmented/Red Spy Tracking System.docx","text":"Note: If the Red Spy PC on the steadicam dies, even if the camera stays on, probably means that the battery is almost dead. On top of the camera is the IR camera, make sure the lens cap is off. The power button on the PC is located on the side with the ports. It will boot into this screen, the points are \"constellation\" on the ceiling of the studio. When they are red, it means the system doesn't know it's location. Move the camera around, rotate it, etc. until the points turn blue. Zoom all the way in and out and Focus all the way in and out to complete the calibration. The gear icon in the bottom right of the PC touchscreen will bring you to the settings. The last icon with the globe and square(?) is the network page. Here you can check the destination IP, which is what tracking hub the system is sending data to, and the port number, which is how one tracking hub identifies different tracking systems. For example in 1A, the Pedestal Camera uses port 6301 and the steadicam uses 6302. Camera and Studio settings are stored in profiles on the Red Spy machine. To load a profile, go to the \"Arrows\" icon in Settings.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
