{"path":"Referenced Material/Reference Library/Vendor/Evertz/Evertz/NBC_30Rock_evEdge_requirements.docx","text":"These are basically all associated with the program release path of a control room.  I’ll give just a brief description below about the expected functionality, and we can dig further into details as needed. Regarding Metadata Encoders/Decoders - The SDI version of these all input or output some kind of trigger – E.g. Contact Closure/GPI, Dial-in or Ethernet for captioning.  We want to explore options for a more modern IP-based protocol for controlling all of these – E.g. control via Magnum, LSB or other control and orchestration system.  Also, we want to explore the mechanics of how metadata actually gets encoded onto video streams.  In the SDI world, this is simply Video In, Video+Metadata Out.  But in an Aspen or TR-03 world, we think it makes more sense for the encoder to simply output an IP metadata stream which can then be multiplexed with video streams through the IP routing fabric. Here’s a HIGHLY simplified diagram of a “standard” NBC Program Path, to give a sense of how we would use these services.  Note, this includes EVERYTHING, though no one control room actually has all of these services: And here’s a quick view of demux/decode services: And here’s the list: Service Priority Client Notes Audio Mux/Demux 2 ALL We understand that audio mux/demux is typically handled within the IP fabric, however we may have need for a module performing this work for certain applications AFD Mux 1 ALL Triggers for setting presets (e.g. 4x3/16x9).  Options to pass AFD, overwrite, etc. Format Converter 1 ALL AFD-sensitive format converter.  Primarily used today for HD/SD conversion, which of course has a limited time applicability.  Other options required for framerate conversion, standards (including, e.g. ASPEN-2022-TR-03), HD/4K. Captions Mux 2 NETWORK Standard captioning.  We typically use Evertz 7800 cards for this today. Caption Demux/Burner 3 NETWORK Receives video with embedded captions and outputs with caption burn-in.  Primary for confidence monitoring.  We perform this work “in-monitor” today. DVE 3 ALL We don’t currently have any workflows requiring downstream DVE, and that work may be moved upstream into production switcher.  But it’s something that comes up from time to time for squeeze-back, etc. Keyer 1 ALL Supporting keying of both external video sources (fill/key) and internal recall/playback of graphics.  This may also be moved upstream into the switcher, but for now it is a requirement for all control rooms.  Today, both downstream DVE and Keyer functions are in ImageStore 750 (1x DVE + 4x Keyer), though we may prefer a more modular option. Namedropper Mux 2 NETWORK Triggers for activating Mux.  Triggers downstream Namedropper keyers at affiliates for Network only. Namedropper 2 NETWORK An all-IP version of Namedropper logo inserter.  May be just a featureset on downstream keyer module. GPI/Trigger Mux/Demux 1 ALL Especially a requirement for MSNBC, though has applications for all production.  Requires encode and decode of various kinds of triggers, including GPI or similar, plus more rich metadata such as Control Room ID or “On-Air” flag. Censor Delay 1 ALL Standard censor delay functionality, triggers for Audio/Video mute, scramble, safe-shot Framesync 1 ALL Frame Synchronizer.  I understand a non-Edge IP module for this may exist today. Regarding quantities of these services, Here are some rough numbers: Main and Alt Program Paths, each 16 Services (total 32): 1x Audio Mux 1x AFD Mux 1x Format Converter (Confidence) 1x Caption Mux 2x Downstream DVE 4x Downstream Keyer 1x Namedropper Mux 1x Namedropper (Confidence) 1x GPI/Trigger Mux 1x GPI/Trigger Demux 1x Censor Delay 1x Framesync Clean and Emergency Program Paths, each 4 services (total 8): 1x Audio Mux 1x AFD Mux 1x Format Converter (Confidence) 1x Framesync That’s 40, and all of those would require X/Y redundancy, for a total of 80 services per control room.  Plus we’ll need to add some overhead for spares and additional ad-hoc functionality (e.g. Audio Demux, which I didn’t include in the above list).  If these are in blocks of 8 services per blade, I would add another 2 per CR for a total of 96 services on 12 blades.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
