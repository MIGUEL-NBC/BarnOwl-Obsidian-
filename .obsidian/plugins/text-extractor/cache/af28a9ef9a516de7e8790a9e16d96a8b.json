This is the service that handles all client communication and issues are exhibited as odd behavior with the Shot box or JL Cooper physical devices or the communication with external interfaces like the audio board, Viz, or DDRs. All IP Address information is kept in a separate document which is updated regularly: https://nbcuni.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/GFXTechnology/EV9qZrwk5dFLm91bDSS1bggBS9ZKbQJh_4FtJYuRf hgvTA?e=3Q8hOM Procedure: 1. Access the webpage of the ELC server using a jumpbox and the IP of the primary server found in the IP Spreadsheet. *NOTE: you must add “/elc” to the IP of the sever* a. If prompted for a login the user is “superadmin” and the password is “S0nye1c!” where the O and I are numbers. 2. On the left pane shown above, click “Alarm Viewer” which is near the bottom of the list. a. The Alarm Viewer page should appear like the below image if the system is in a healthy state.

Clicking “Alarm Viewer” on the side panel as in step 2 will refresh the view. a. If there are 2 red bubbles below “EC” for more than 60 seconds, repeat step 3. If the issue continues attempt the restart or start a third time while escalating the issue. 5. The alarm viewer page should now appear as it did in step 2. 6. EGPI controller for both Viz and DreamCatcher should also be restarted. This info can be found in steps 7, 8, 9 in the “SOP_ELC_PM_Restarts” document. a. If operations has escalated, they should be aware of how to restart eGPI. 7. Operations should open On Air Playlist and validate control of the below systems a. Switcher & shot boxes b. Audio board & JL Cooper audio controllers c. Viz Director (via eGPI Controller) d. DreamCatcher transitions (via eGPI Controller) e. EVS 8. If problems persist with only a single device, check that eGPI Controller shows a green “CONNECTED” status. This windows also allows for a test fire which will narrow the issue down to ELC or eGPI (if the test works, it is likely not communicating with the ELC server properly.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
