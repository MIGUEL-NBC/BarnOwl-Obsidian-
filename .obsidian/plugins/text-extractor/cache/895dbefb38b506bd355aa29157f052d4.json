In the event an AJA converter needs to be replaced, there are several spares available. It’s important to know what settings are configured on the converter going in as each monitor gets a different config depending on its position. The rendering below shows each monitor number as you look northward inside the studio. Based on the salvos and Multiplay layouts, the following configurations are needed: Monitors 1, 4, 5, and 8: Left Orientation Monitors 2, Track 1, 6, and Track 2: Center Orientation Monitors 3 and 7: Right Orientation If you are updating the config on an already-setup AJA converter, you can simply load a preset via the AJA Config Utility software from the OneDrive folder. If you load the preset associated with the correct monitor, the proper sizing and orientation will already be set for you (IMPORTANT NOTE: the AJA software will not correctly show the input sizing unless you close out of the software and open it again). It’s important to make an adjustment to the config after loading the preset file, as it doesn’t properly save with the preset. Go to Audio tab and mute all three audio options by selecting the checkbox. If you are configuring a brand new AJA ROI-SDI converter, you can load the preset but you will still need to make the changes above as well as manually set the input cropping region. See below for the three orientations: LEFT: CENTER: RIGHT: Lastly, make sure the Output tab looks as follows for all orientations:","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
