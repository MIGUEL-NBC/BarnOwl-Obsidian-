{"path":"PDF Library/Robo/Manual CCU routing for Robo control.docx","text":"Manual CCU routing for Robo control I will be using 3X as an example as that is the route that needs changing right now. Go to video position and look at the VIP that has the wrong CCU in it. You will see a UMD label that will look like 3S ROBO CAM X1 CCU 13 Now in SDVN, search for 3S ROBO CAM X1 as a destination. Route whichever CCU you want into this. Do not change anything else in the path, just this destination. Repeat for all 3 cameras. Wohler routing is based off the subscription so you will not need to route anything specifically to the Wohler as long as you have routed the above correctly. Every studio has its own unique destination as seen above. I.E, 3X/3AW is Cam X1, 3, 5; 4E TSQ is CAM 4ETS1, 2, 3, 4 etc. The salvo thrown by the operator simply changes which of these destinations they are looking at on the VIP. Not what is routed to these destinations.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
