Please see #4 Service Menu Display in HDC3500 V 3.01(attached). We had this problem in 8H and had to remove the camera from the sled to get to the service menu. Version 3.01 will fix that. The new HDCU3100 version will add a password to the web GUI and make it more secure but nowhere does it say it will stop it from freezing up. I still do not know what is causing this.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
