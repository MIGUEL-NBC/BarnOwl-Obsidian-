NCS Connectivity Company Confidential ▪ Special Note: ▪ The NCS to Frame Controller connections require specific SFP types: • On EXE-NCS-A , 10GE ports use MO-10GE-SFP-10KM • On EXE-FC , 10GE ports use SFP10G-TR13-A • On EXE-FC , 1GE ports use SFPTR-RJ45-SER-AV EXE SFP Types Company Confidential ▪ Power Supply status information can be found on the NCS Guest web interface ▪ These are 200-240V AC Power Supplies operate at 50 or 60 Hz ▪ Dual feed architecture where AC feed 1 powers slot 0 and 1 and AC feed 2 powers slot 2 and 3 EXE Power Supply Company Confidential ▪ To view the PSU Interface, connect an Ethernet cable from the Control Network to the front of the PSU unit. ▪ Use a web browser to open the Power Supply Unit (PSU) web interface, login with username Admin and password exeadmin. By default each PSU’s IP is set to 192.168.0.230. ▪ Verify System Voltage is set to 48V ▪ On the Modules page, verify all rectifiers have a similar current value. EXE Power Supply Interface Company Confidential ▪ The power supply comes with an external power switch mounted on a 1RU panel. ▪ There is one switch for the power supplies at the top of the frame and one switch for the supplies at the bottom of the frame. ▪ When the switch is in the Off position all the power modules will be shutdown ▪ Each switch has a mating cable, with four alarm connectors. • The alarm connectors are required for the power tray to current share and therefore must be plugged into the back of each operating power supply tray. EXE Power Switch Company Confidential ▪ The following 2 parameters are essential to the EXE functionality: • Controller: Controller should always read ONLINE, this is essential to being able to the EXE frame being controlled by Magnum-SDVN • Peer Controller: this should always read SETTINGS MATCH as this will indicate that the 2 NCS Guests are in full communication, both NCS Guests run hot-hot so they should always have matched settings for proper functionality Essential Monitoring – NCS Guest Company Confidential ▪ The EXE Chassis fans status can be checked on the Chassis page of the web interface ▪ The status and temperature are both monitored for each of the 6 fans EXE Fan Status Company Confidential ▪ The EXE Frame controllers operate as Main and Redundant ▪ FC’s are large Switches as opposed to having the traditional function of a Frame controller ▪ Their status as well as the status of the Reference can be found on the Frame Controller Page of the web UI EXE Frame Controller Company Confidential ▪ The Crosspoint modules can be monitored on the NCS Guest web interface under the Fabric Card page EXE Crosspoint Modules Company Confidential ▪ The LC presence and temperature can be monitored from the Line Card page of the NCS Guest web interface. ▪ The front of the physical LC has tri-coloured LEDs to indicate to the user the status of each port. • To check the status of the CXP ports flip the last DIP switch. EXE Line Cards LED Colour Indication Blue This colour LED indicates that the associated port is up. Red/Blue This colour LED will appear pink and means the associated port is receiving. Blue/Green This colour LED indicates that the associated port is transmitting. Red/Blue/Green This colour LED indicated that the associated port is receiving and transmitting. Red This colour LED indicates that the associated port has either a local or remote fault. No Colour An LED that displays no colour indicates that the port is down. Company Confidential ▪ For each of the physical ports on the rear of the EXE the user can set and view the parameters of each port • Speed • Operation • RX/TX bandwidth • Transceiver Status • And many more EXE Port Status Company Confidential EXE40 Port Mapping Main I/O Top • from LC1 (right most card, top to bottom) ports 1 – 36 • main I/O ports go from 1 - 576 Expansion I/O Top • from LC1 (right most card, top to bottom) ports 1153 – 1188 • CXP I/O top ports go from 1153 - 1728 Expansion I/O Bottom • from LC1 (right most card, bottom to top) ports 1729– 1764 • CXP I/O ports go from 1729 - 2304 Main I/O Bottom • from LC1 (right most card, bottom to top) ports 577 – 612 • main I/O ports go from 577 - 1152 Company Confidential EXE28 Port Mapping Main I/O • from LC1 (right most card, top to bottom) ports 1 – 36 • main I/O ports go from 1 - 576 Expansion I/O • from LC1 (right most card, top to bottom) ports 577 – 612 • CXP I/O ports go from 577 – 1152 •These are physically ports 1152 to 1726 Company Confidential EXE16 Port Mapping Main I/O Ports 1 - 144 Main I/O Ports 145 - 288 Expansion I/O Ports 289 - 432 Expansion I/O Ports 433 - 576 Company Confidential ▪ Each of the 3 expansion ports breaks out to 12 individual ports ▪ Unlike the expansion on the EXE28 and EXE40 the physical ports 1-12 alternate in value as to which ones are associated to which port values (see image →) EXE16 Expansion Port (CXP) Mapping 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 CXP Physical Ports EXE Port AssignmentEXE Port Assignment CXP #1 CXP #2 CXP #3 Company Confidential ▪ For each available multicast source the user can view the • Destination IP Address (multicast) • Ingress Port • Source IP address • Traffic Rate EXE Multicast Sources Company Confidential ▪ The multicast maintenance page provides a visual representation of any unrouted flows in the system • The Rebalance Now button can be used if there was a crosspoint failover that has been corrected if you would like to rebalance the sources on the crosspoints • NOTE: this should be used carefully as it will cause a small service interruption. EXE Multicast Maintenance Company Confidential ▪ This page contains the details on the internal path the multicast will travel ▪ Locate the Multicast IP and you can see the route it is travelling, from the ingress line card, to the cross point and to the egress line card EXE Multicast Routes Company Confidential ▪ All of the Multicasts which are discovered on the ingress ports will appear here and then can be added to the list of multicast sources by selecting Add. EXE Multicast Discovery Company Confidential ▪ Connect NCS to FC using fiber connections and 1G connections • One fiber cable to each FC from each NCS for a total of 2 per NCS (repeat this with the 1G connections) ▪ Connect Power Supply’s to frame ▪ Connect LC ports to edge devices ▪ Power on Frame ▪ Ensure the Controller returns Online, if it is Offline the EXE won’t allow incoming connections • Magnum will not connect if the controller is offline.
