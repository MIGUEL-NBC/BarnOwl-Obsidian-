The received characters must exactly match the order and value of the entered patterns. If a received character does not match the entered pattern, all previous matches are discarded and the match process begins again with the first entered pattern. If more than 1 second elapses between received characters, all previous matches are discarded and the match process begins again. Use %yz to enter a HEX character. ‘y’ and ‘z’ are values 0 - 9, A - F, or 'X' (don’t care). Enter %Xz to match only the z part of the HEX character. Enter %yX to match only the y part of the HEX character. Enter %XX to ignore the received value. Use #yyyyyyyy to match an exact bit pattern. ‘y’ values are '0', '1', or 'X' (don't care). For example, enter #0XXX1XXX to match bit7= 0 and bit3= 1. Bit0 is on the far right. Bit7 is on the far left. Use <yyyyyyyy to match any bit in the bit pattern. ‘y’ values are '0', '1', or 'X' (don't care). For example, enter <0XXX1XXX to match bit7=0 or bit3= 1. Bit0 is on the far right. Bit7 is on the far left. Use '!' to NOT match a character pattern. For example: Event Label= TEST. Receive pattern= !A. If any character other than 'A' is received, then TEST event is ON. If 'A' is received, then TEST event is OFF. Use !y, !%yz, or !#yyyyyyyy to specify a NOT pattern match. NOTE- Spaces between patterns are ignored. Use %20 to match a space character.

Upon receipt of a Sequence Start action, the timer for the Sequence’s first entry in the Event Action Table will start. Upon receipt of a Sequence Stop action, the sequence will immediately stop. The sequence entry in progress will halt without executing. The next Start action will cause the sequence to start at its first entry in the Event Action Table. When the last Sequence action executes, the sequence will automatically turn off and stop executing. If the last Sequence action is Sequence Start, the sequence will loop until a Sequence Stop is received. Example #1 Wait for Sequence Start action and then play sequence until end and stop.
