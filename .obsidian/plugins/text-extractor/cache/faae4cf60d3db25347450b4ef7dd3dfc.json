The Application provides fast, simple, and reliable control over video and graphic playout devices for live and live-to-tape programming, including national and local news, sports, lifestyle and talk shows, and faith-based productions. The Production Control Application can serve as a complete, live-production control system, or it can simply fill in the control gaps of existing production systems. Basic System •(2) DC20 Device Controllers that interface to four devices each and support a wide range of control protocols for VTRs, video servers, graphic devices, NRCS, and production switchers. • (1) CP20 Control Panel provides tactile VTR-style control for fast, simple, reliable playout control. • (1) ST420 Shotbox provides one-button instantaneous access to on-air and on-set content - video, graphics, fill & key - for single and multi-channel playout. Expansion Options The Production Control Application can be expanded to control a combination of up to 24 independent channels and devices. Using the available MOS option, the Production Control Application completely integrates with most newsroom systems and further provides a MOS gateway for non-MOS compliant devices. The result is an integrated stand-alone, tactile control system, or a sophisticated cost-effective backup and manual playout control system always at hand. Integrated Control DNF’s Production Control Application is a complete, semi-automated production control infrastructure that works with existing control room equipment to simplify production control, expand production capabilities, enhance production look and branding, and minimize production errors. With it, preproduction setup is fast and easy, and last-minute on-air changes are easily handled for late-breaking and unscripted events. contro l | monitoring | inter facing V: 818.898.3380 F: 818.898.3360 sales@dnfcontrols.com www.dnfcontrols.com Leveraging 20+ Years of Must- Work Control Solutions DNF has more than 20 years of experi- ence providing “must work,” mission- critical control systems for broadcast and production operations. DNF Controls’ core competencies: Tactile Control The Production Control base system controls up to eight channels of VTRs, DDRs, production servers, and graphic devices for on-air and on-set playout — including one dedicated to a video switcher — from highly reliable, easy-to- use, tactile control panels and your production switcher. With the Production Control Application, you can: • Control playout of video segments, graphic transitions, interstitials, teasers, promos, looping backgrounds, graphics, and more • Load and play video segments/clips on one channel or across multiple channels, and simultaneously roll Fill/Key channel pairs Modular Architecture Designed for enhanced scalability, Flex Control Network affords high speed, real- time multitasking to run all your devices simultaneously and seamlessly. The system’s unique architecture and modular design lets you customize placement of tactile control panels and device controllers to optimize efficiency, and allows changes to be made to individual devices without affecting the whole operation. As your system grows, Flex’s distributed processing ensures reliability and flexibility without the need for special training, programming, or in-depth technical knowledge. Every operator action and system action are logged for later review. Simple remote access to log files provides quick and easy diagnostic data to resolve system and operational issues. Implement changes on-site or remotely over your network using any browser. Among the benefits are dramatically lower downtime, quick resolution of problems, and a learning tool for post-show analysis of production errors. IP Technology The IP-based Flex Control Network is engineered from the ground up to deliver a network-grade infrastructure that reliably and accurately controls connected devices in the same room, across campus, and around the globe. More than a mere controller, the Flex Control Network embodies a distinctively robust and dynamic infrastructure to elevate your system designs to higher levels of performance and reliability. Flex Control Network provides rock-solid networking and IP control, and unique modular configuration control — with no programming needed! Robust Ethernet IP technology is the heart of Flex Control Network, giving it networking abilities that are second to none. Flex Control Network uses an embedded, non-Windows® operating system, so it won’t compromise your network. Whether it resides on a sensitive corporate LAN or a dedicated network, or users access it through VPN, Flex Control Network provides reliable connectivity and accurate control for your complete line of devices throughout your facility — and around the world.The control panels talk over Ethernet to the device controllers, which contain the control protocols. By separating the control panels and device controllers, broadcasters can create centralized systems in an equipment or control room, or distributed systems that allows users to control playout devices with frame accuracy via Ethernet from anywhere in the world. This distributed system architecture means that failure of an individual piece will not cripple the entire system. With cost- effective implementation and ownership, Flex Control Network supports remote configuration, training, and diagnostics backed by the experts of DNF Controls, the recognized leader in IP-based “event to action” control systems.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
