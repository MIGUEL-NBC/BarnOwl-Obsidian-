First Set-Ups During first start-up, choosing the location of the Config folder is necessary. It is recommended to store the Config folder on the internal network, which can ideally be accessed from several working stations. The Config folder is the location for the log file, saved presets, user information and the topology file. The IP address and the routing structure are defined in the topology file. When starting to work with the software, Username and Password are required. Initial Password: “password” Additional users can be added and the password can be changed in the menu field “main configurations” (see chapter 4.1).

Deleting Connections between Studios and Control Rooms To delete a single connection, click on the little red cross in the desired column of either Cam or CCU. If drawing a connection between Cams and CCUs is not possible, there might already exist another connection which has to be deleted first in order to create a new one. This connection is highlighted in red. How to Use the opticamSWITCH 11 To delete all connections of either a Studio or a Control Room, click on the large red cross in the corner of the desired Studio or Control Room. The opticamSWITCH is equipped with an Intelligent Power Working Circuit, protecting the electrical relays from switching under load if the voltage exceeds the maximum voltage. Once the voltage exceeds this maximum, the deleting of connections as highlighted in orange is blocked. Switch off the camera in order to be able to delete the connection.
