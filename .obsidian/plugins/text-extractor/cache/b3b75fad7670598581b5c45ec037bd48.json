This seems be caused by a communication breakdown between the Sony DCU and DNF GTP which eventually connects to the Evertz DreamCatcher. By restarting the DNF GTP-30, DNF GTP-v1 and the DreamCatcher AMP service, the issue can be averted for 18-36 hours. This process has been completed daily before operations arrives to prevent the issue from causing on-air impacts. Procedure: 1. Access the vueweb shortcut for the DreamCatcher serving Gold and Silver (100.103.244.175/vueweb). The username and password are “DMCR-075A” for both fields if prompted. 2. Navigate to the services page and the “dcsamp” service which should look like the below image. 3. Click the toggle next the “Enable DCSAMP” which will cause a prompt to appear at the service title bar.

Navigte to the ACI vCenter instance (100.113.19.101) and login with VProd credentials. Navigate the “DNF” folder on the Y-side cluster. a. Power down “GTP-Y4” 5. Restart the DNF GTP-30 at 100.103.244.186 a. Navigate to “System” on the top right and enter “controls” as the password b. Locate the “Restart the System” link and again enter “controls” 6. Navigate back to the DreamCatcher page and re-enable the dcsamp service by repeating step 3. 7. Allow the AMP service to restart, about 30 seconds, then go back to vCenter and power on the GTPs from step 4a. 8. Go to the orchestration Client Host (100.103.224.24) and access the salvos page. a. If doing this work near air or while the CR is on air, the operators can fire this save during a commercial break from their Orchestration Salvos list on the VUE panel under “Salvos” 3 | P a g e 9. Locate the salvo called “CR74_DMCR_NORM” and fire the salvo twice. 10. Go to the webpage of GTP-Y2 at 100.103.244.186 and click “Protocol Assignment” to see if the devices are communicating. Channels 1 & 3 should display a status that is NOT “No Client Comm” or “No Comm with Automation” 11. If playout statuses are shown (I.e. not the statuses listed in step 9), then the process is complete. Otherwise, continue to step 11. 12. On the GTP webpage, click “System” at the top right corner. Password is “controls” 4 | P a g e 13. Click “Restart the System” and enter the password “controls” 14. Wait about 30 seconds then refresh the page and follow step 9 again","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
