Alpha Channel: Additional channel that saves the relative transparency value additionally to the color information. The alpha channel is an additional channel that saves the relative transparency value additionally to the color information. 

Auto Transition: Automatic Transition execution on the M/E or PGM/PST bank via a button operation. (Not via manual fader operation) 

AUX OUT: Auxiliary output, where a connector outputs a subsidiary signal to external devices such as external DVEs and monitors. In comparison Program Output is used for On-air and finished package recording. 

Ancillary Data: Replayable data such as embedded audio, which is recorded into frame memory clip with video. 

Chroma Key: A type of key. A key signal based on a particular color is used to cut out the background, and the key fill is then inserted. The inserted signal is also referred to as the foreground, and the composite image is called a chroma key image. 

Clip Transition: One type of transition. Allows playback of a frame memory clip synchronizing with a background transition, like mix and wipe. 

Color Background: The dedicated generator that creates color signals. These can be used as color backgrounds in video effects. 
Color Corrector (CCR): Color correcting function for video signal. 

Cross Point: Circuit part that allows switching video input signal. Or, operational switching buttons on the control panel.

Color Mix: Allows you to create a “mix color” signal, combining two different colors with a pattern from a pattern generator, to be used to fill a background, border, and so on. Also may be used to soften the border line. 

DME (Digital Multi Effects): A feature name from Sony, generally called DVE (Digital Video Effects) outside Sony. Provides 3D transformation like location, size, rotation and all the other various special video effects using the Track Ball Module or Joystick Module. More complicated and sophisticated effects are possible by combining multiple channels. Sony only refers to the function which enables 3D effects. For 2D effects, however, it is referred to as a Resizer, other companies also refer to 2D effects as DVE. 

DME Wipe: A DME wipe is a wipe transition that uses a DME effect to change from one video image to the next. There are two types of DME wipe: those which can be selected for a normal transition, and those which can be selected for an independent key transition. 

DME Wipe Snapshot: Snapshot and save a DME wipe pattern together with the current settings of its modifiers and pattern limit, either in a flexipad module or 10 key module with a dedicated register for recall when required. There are 99 DME wipe snapshot registers for each of the M/E and P/P banks. 

DSK (Down Stream Key): A key that is inserted after (downstream) to the M/E output. This is sometimes referred to as a DSK. 

Dual Link: The method of signal transfer that is used for 1080P/59.94 or 1080P/50 content. This is defined by the SMPTE372M standard. It allows data transition with increased number of frames or color depth due to dual the HD-SDI signal transmission providing a total bandwidth of 3Gbps. Two separate cables are required hence the name. 

Device Control Unit (DCU): The unit allows controlling external device (VTR or DDR etc) via a switcher. The Sony DCU also has tally / GPI connections. 

EDL (Edit Decision List): A command list for executing an edit, or the list file made out of an editing controller. This term is used with the PIE (Plug In Editor). 

Fade to Black: Gradually darken then switch to black on the program output of the PGM/PST. 

Fader Lever: The position of the fader bar, move this to adjust the fader level and carry out a manual transition. Pressing the [KF] button to turn it on allows you to use this as a key frame fader. 

Fixed Bus Mode: In this mode, A-Bus signal is output when the fader lever is located at the top end. When fader lever is located at the bottom end the B-Bus signal is output. This is essentially the opposite of flip-flop mode where the A and B bus signal is exchanged when the fader is moved from top to bottom. Also see “flip flop mode”. 

FlexiPad™: The powerful LCD button module on the control panel which enables the user to store and recall wipe pattern, DME Wipe Pattern, Effect, Snapshot, Macro, Shotbox and Transition rate etc. 

Flip-Flop Mode: Normally, when a background transition is carried out on an M/E bank, the signals selected on the A and B rows of cross-point buttons are interchanged at the end of the transition. That is to say, except during a transition, the background output is always from the background A bus. Also see “fixed bus mode”. 

Frame Memory Clip: A sequence of still images, which appear as a movie on playback, that is stored in the switchers frame memory. The sequence can be captured into memory then recalled or saved for later use. This is also referred to simply as a “clip.” The files (still files) constituting a clip are referred to as a “clip file.” 

Frame Memory: Frame memory is a function whereby a frame of input video can be frozen and written to memory, for further use as material for editing. You can also play recorded frame memory clips (movies). 

Key Bus: Cross point button row for selecting key source and key fill. CCP-8000 and CCP-6000 panels have 2 bus button rows on each M/E (P/P) and the signal for Key1 and key2 can be selected. By pressing the Key3 and Key4 button, key source and key fill for key3 and key4 are selected. 

Key Fill: The signal that replaces the cut-out part is termed “key fill.” 

Key Source: The signal determining how the background is cut out when using a key is termed “key source”. 

Key Type: The type of key source processing, various versions are available: Luminance Key, Linear 

Key, Color Vector Key, Chroma Key, Wipe Pattern Key, and Key Wipe Pattern Key

Key Wipe Pattern Key: One of key types. Put key fill in the wipe pattern that the key transition selects. 

Key: A key is an effect in which a part of the background image is replaced by an image or superimposed text. The signal determining how the background is cut out is termed “key source,” and the signal that replaces the cut-out part is termed “key fill.” The system component responsible for processing a key is referred to as a keyer. 

Keyer: The system component responsible for processing a key. 

Macro: Refers to the function on the control panel that allows you to recall a series of selections when required to automatically execute the same sequence of operations. To record menu operations in memory, use a menu macro. 0.5M/E (Simple PP, Half M/E): See Simple P/P Software. 

M/E: Mix/Effect block. The part of hardware or control panel /operational function that switches video signal. 

M/E Bank Display: This indicates the notional mix/effect bank name to which the particular M/E or PGM/PST bank is assigned, as a four-character identifier. 

Non-Synchronized: If the fader lever is stopped in the middle of transition, when the transition is completed by the Auto Transition Button, the fader position and transition is not synchronized. This situation is referred to as Non-Synchronized and the LED on the top and bottom beside the fader lever are lit. 

Frame Memory: Frame memory is a function whereby a frame of input video can be frozen and written to 3 memory, for further use as material for editing. You can also play recorded frame memory clips (movies). 

Next Transition: To execute a transition, it is first necessary to decide how the image will be changed as a result of the transition. This selection is carried out using the next transition selection buttons in the transition control block of each M/E or PGM/PST bank. 

P/P (Program Preset, PGM/PST Block): The last output row in M/E rows, which is used at on-air. Pattern Mix: Allows user to create new pattern combining selected two patterns (main and sub): Mix, Positive Nam (+NAM), Negative Nam(-NAM), Morphing PIE (Plug In Editor): A combination of hardware keyboard control and a software option for the switcher that allows powerful linear editing functionality and capabilities. This allows for quick and simple creation of programs without the need to import material into a computer based editing package. 

Primary Input: Input signal for the switcher. 

Re-Entry: Allows you to select the video created on another bank as background A or B or one of the keys 1 to 4. For example, to use the video created on the M/E-1 bank as background B on the M/E-2 bank, press the reentry button [M/E 1] in the background B row of buttons on the M/E-2 bank. 

Registers: An area of memory in a switcher system which holds a snapshot, keyframe, macro, and so on. 

Secondary Color Correction: Allows correcting, brightness, color saturation and color phase (in ±30 degree range) on 6-colors; R (Red), G (Green), B (Blue), Y (Yellow), C (Cyan), M (Magenta). Partial masking on the corrected area is possible as well. 

Side Flag: Refers to the areas to left and right of an image with aspect ratio 4:3 embedded within a 16:9 frame, when these areas are filled with a separate image selected from the utility 1 bus. You can adjust the width of the side flag area. 

Simple P/P Software: PP block focuses only on simple function (i.e. some features like Chromakey, Key Border, DME Wipe are not available) in comparison to a Full M/E (PP). This software allows the additional functionality without using additional M/E hardware. 

Snapshot: One of the memory features of the switcher system. On-demand call up and playback function that allows storing setting status as data in register to reproduce the status. 

Split Fader: Refers to the function of carrying out a transition with the fader lever split into left and right halves, so that the background A and background B buses can be manipulated separately. 

Spot Color Adjustment: Allows changing color at a certain area without any other impact. Partial masking is also possible as well as the following correction against the area unchanged in color. Overall gain level of video signal, Gain of Y-signal, Offset of Y-signal, Gain of C-signal, Color phase of C-signal. 

Super Mix: One of the transition types. The current video is maintained at 100% output for the first half of the transition as the new video is mixed while increasing progressively to 100%. The current video is then progressively reduced from 100% to zero in the second half while the new video is maintained at 100%. 

Transition: To switch current image to new one using transition type like Mix, Wipe, DME Wipe, Super Mix, Preset Color Mix, NAM and Clip Transition. 

Transition Generator for Keyer: Each keyer can set independent transition (=local transition) type aside from next transition (=common transition). Combining common transition with local transition, background and keyer can be set different transition type. 

Wipe: A transition from one video signal to another with a specific shape, pattern or line.
