It controls instructions between Trios and Engines, along with GPI control from the switcher. They are located near the control rooms, not centrally like the engines and Trios. Admin credentials are : \\localadmin ;[ The MSE must be up and running, or you will not be able to open any Trio that connects to that MSE. If the MSE goes down, all connected Trios will disconnect and close. GPI from the switcher is routed through the MSE, and there will be an A/B switch to move GPI control between MSE 1 & 2. Keep in mind if the control room needs to switch to the backup. On the MSE, the Media Sequencer Launcher should be open and running in the console, not as a Windows Service. When rebooted, you can manually reopen this and select open in console. .","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
