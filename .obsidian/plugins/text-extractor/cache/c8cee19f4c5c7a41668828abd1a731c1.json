{"path":"PDF Library/Vendor/Cedar/In the event of a Cedar failure in CR 31.pdf","text":"In the event of a Cedar failure in CR 31/32. the first action should be to remove the Cedar from the mix by assigning mics to Group 1 before any other steps are taken. Please carefully review the notes and instructions below and please ask if you have any questions - the expectation is that every audio engineer can react in this situation. The Cedar lost power this morning during first look. For first look / morning joe. The “Morning Joe 3A Studio” board on the calrec is loaded regularly for those shows. That board is preset with the 3A studio mics in group 5 (first group of the cedar), instead of the normal group 1 (default mic group) because of the noise level 3A studio typically produces. To put the selected fader / mic back into mic group #1 (no cedar) simply tap 5 to unselect it and tap 1. The cedar is not required for any channel to pass audio but it is a useful tool for noise reduction / microphone mixing. The Cedar takes approximately 6-8 seconds to reboot if power is lost. To shut down the Cedar manually, hold down the power button which is on the top left until the LOCKED setting is deactivated (about 3 seconds). Then hold the power button again to shut it down completely. To turn it back on, simply press the power button, once the Cedar menu comes back up, the power button is unlocked, to lock it again just tap the power button once and it will set to LOCKED mode to prevent from accidentally shutting it down. Most boards do not come up with studio mics in group 5, but the Morning Joe board does. Please be mindful of that and assign mics accordingly.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
