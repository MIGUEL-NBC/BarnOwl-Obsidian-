CPU and SG Block The CPU and SG block consists of a CA-82/82A board. The CA-82/82A board has the following functions. . Overall unit control . Generation of clock in synchronization of the reference clock and timing signal and their supply to each board . Communication with Control LAN and Data LAN . RS-422 communication . GPI input/output control . Interface with compact flash The main CPU (CPU-DP module) on the CA-82/82A board controls entire unit. The main CPU is connected to the local CPUs in the cross point block, M/E block, frame memory block, and DME block through the Gigabit Ethernet HUB on the CA-82/82A board to achieve overall control. The main CPU indirectly controls the output processor block and the format converter block through the cross point block. The child SG-272 board on the CA-82/82A board generates the reference clock and the timing signal. The dedicated ASIC (IC3, IC4) and the FPGA (IC2) are used for data communication with Network A (Control LAN) and Network B (Data LAN) of the CA-82 board, and these devices are controlled by the main CPU. The Ethernet Controller of the main CPU performs transmission and reception of Network A (Control LAN) and Network B (Data LAN) of the CA-82A board. The child SIO-26 board on the CA-82/82A board controls RS-422 communication. The main CPU also controls GPI input and output through IC5. IC5 controls acquisition of information such as PSU_STATUS, FAN_STATUS, and BD_STATUS, and also controls peripheral functions such as FAN_CTRL. The CA-82/82A board has a circuit for interface with the compact flash card socket and the main CPU.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
