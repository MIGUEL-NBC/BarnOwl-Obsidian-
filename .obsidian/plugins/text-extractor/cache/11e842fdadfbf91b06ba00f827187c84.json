The card is capable of supporting up to 6.2 Tbps of BW. Card is hot-swappable as cables are de-coupled from line card via the main IO fin. 8 Line cards fit in an EXE16 frame, 16 Line cards fit in an EXE28 frame, and 32 Line Cards fit in an EXE40 frame. Main IO Fin supports up to 64x 25G/10G/1G ports via 16x QSPF28/QSFP+ modules. Each QSFP supports 4 ports, which can be used as independent links or ganged to support 40G or 100G Ethernet (with the appropriate optical module). QSFP Modules are hot swappable and come in both single mode (1310nm) and multimode mode options (850nm). QSFP28 (25G capable) 1310nm optical modules support distance up to 2km. QSFP28 (25G capable) 850nm optical modules support distance up to 100m with OM4 fiber, 70m with OM3 fiber. QSFP+ (10G/1G capable) 1310nm optical modules support distance up to 10km. QSFP+ (10G capable) 850nm optical modules support distance up to 400m with OM4 fiber, 300m with OM3 fiber. Interface to optical module is and MTP/MPO connector that supports 8 strands of fiber. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Evertz Microsystems Ltd. 5292 John Lucas Drive, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, L7L 5Z9 Port assignment is the optical module is indicated in the diagram below. The first 4 positions are receives (RX) and the last 4 are transmits (TX). PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Evertz Microsystems Ltd. 5292 John Lucas Drive, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, L7L 5Z9 Connecting devices that support QSFP interface requires a Type B MTP-8 cable. Pinout with appropriate cross-over is indicated below. Please note cables that support SMF have APC ferrules on MTP connectors. Cables that support MMF fiber have UPC ferrules on MTP connectors. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL Evertz Microsystems Ltd. 5292 John Lucas Drive, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, L7L 5Z9 MTP-8 cables can also be broken out to individual strands and terminated with LC connectors. This type of cable will allow you to terminate the 4 channels from the QSFP module to 4 independent SFP modules. See cable coloring and breakout assignment below.
