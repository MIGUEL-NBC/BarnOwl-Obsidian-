DME Block The DME section is an option (MKS-7470X/MKS-7471X) of the MVS-7000X. DVP-53 Board (MKS-7470X, MKS-7471X) The DVP-53 board consists of the following blocks. . SDI input/output block . PVMIX block (Pre Video Modify & MIX) . FINTPU block (Filter & Interpolator) . AINTPL block (Address Generator & Interpolator) . VMIX block The DVP-53 board is controlled by the local CPU module (CPU-DP) on this board. [SDI input/output block]: IC5, IC6 This block converts the SDI signal sent from the cross point block (XPT-32 board) to parallel signal, and then sends the parallel signal to the PVMIX block. This block eliminates phase differences in input signals and performs video processing (including video level adjustment for each input). Furthermore, this block converts the signal sent from the VMIX block to SDI signal, and sends the SDI signal to the cross point block (XPT-32 board). [PVMIX block]: IC11 This block sends the video/key signals received from the SDI input/output block to the FINTPU block and sends the return video/key signals processed in the FINTPU block and the AINTPL block to the PVMIX block. The PVMIX block has the following main functions. . Border/Crop/Beveled Edge . Video Modify (including Posterization, Solarization, and Mosaic) . Input Freeze . Mask key generation . Recursive [FINTPU block]: IC7, IC8 This block fi rst performs horizontal Defocus/Blur and Filtering processing (Antialias Filter) according to the reduction rate. Then this block sorts data (Scan Conversion) using the DDR2 SDRAM and then performs vertical Defocus/Blur and Antialias Filter processing. The video/key signals are sent to the AINTPL block and are written to the DDR2 SDRAM for interpolation. After that, this block receives the address generated in the AINTPL block. Data is read from the DDR2 SDRAM according to this address and horizontal interpolation processing is performed. Output data is sent to the AINTPU block. The FINTPU block has the following main functions. . Antialias Filter (in horizontal and vertical directions) . Scan Conversion . Defocus/Blur . EffectG2 Mask or Mask . Interpolation [AINTPL block]: IC9, IC10 The Field/Frame Conversion processing is applied to the video/key signals received from the FINTPU block using the DDR2 SDRAM, and the converted signals are written to the DDR2 SDRAM for interpolation. Furthermore, an address for 3D Linear Transform is generated in this block, data is read from the DDR2 SDRAM according to this address, and horizontal interpolation processing is performed. Then the interpolated video/key signals of the FINTPU block are received for vertical interpolation. The video/key signals are then sent to the PVMIX block where Lighting synthesis is applied to the video/key signals by the Light key generated in the AINTPL block. The AINTPL block has the following main functions. . 3D Linear Transform . Non-linear . Interpolation . Lighting . Field/Frame Conversion [VMIX block]: IC12 This block sends video/key signals received from the PVMIX block to the SDI input/output block. The VMIX block has the following main functions. .
