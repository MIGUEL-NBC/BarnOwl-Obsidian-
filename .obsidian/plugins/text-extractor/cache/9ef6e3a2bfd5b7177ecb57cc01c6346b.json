The reason for this upgrade is performance/stability fixes as well as the long awaited “Unity” Control feature to all the REMs. Due to how time consuming the process is and the long testing procedure of each REM, we are going to break the REM-ITXE Card Upgrades into 2-3 nights. We completed the first (54) REMs (REM 1-54) and had (2) cards that did not accept the upgrades (REM 27 & 42). These (2) ITXE Cards become inoperable from the failed upgrade, so MTC removed them from service for the night through the morning. Since we were running out of time for the window, we decided to replace the ITXE Cards in the morning. As always, please be aware of any reports about these REMs and let us know if anything pops up.
