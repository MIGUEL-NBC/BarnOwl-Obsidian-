CA-47 Board (MKS-8700) The CA-47 board performs the following functions. Communication with Center Control Panel (CCP) using the peripheral LAN, control of the RC-90 board and IF-848 board that are installed as options, generating the sync signal from the REF video signal, the Tally/GPI input, and serial tally output. The CA-47 board is installed in slot 1 of the MKS-8700 main unit. The CPU-DK module (main CPU board) that is connected to CN201 controls the Ethernet Controller. The control signal passes through the MB-949 board and the CN-2198 board on the rear, and establishes communication with the Center Control Panel (CCP) at CN202. The CPU- DK module establishes interface with PIO on the RC-90 board that is installed in slot 2 to slot 6, by receiving command from the Center Control Panel. In the same manner, the CPU-DK module establishes interface with the IF-848 board using the 32-bit dual port RAM on the IF-848 board that is installed in slot 2 to 6. In the same manner, the CPU-DK module interfaces with the SIO that controls RS-422A via the 8-bit dual port RAM. The serial tally signal supplied from SIO passes through the driver/receiver complying with the RS-422A standard, again passes through the MB-949 board and the CN-2198 board on the rear, and finally interfaces with external equipment at CN201. The Tally/GPI input signals that are input to CN301 to CN303 on the CN-2193 board on the rear slot 1, passes through the MB-949 board, and are input to PIO on the CA-47 board. The CPU- DK module reads out contents of the PIO and sends the Center Control Panel of the contents. The REF video signal that is input to CN601 or CN602 of the CN-2199 board on the rear is sent to the sync separator circuit where the sync signal is generated. The power supply voltages of +3.3 V and +5 V within the CA-47 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-949 board.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
