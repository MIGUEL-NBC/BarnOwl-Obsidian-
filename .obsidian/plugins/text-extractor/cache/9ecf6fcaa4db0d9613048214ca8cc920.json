What is TDM Audio Company Confidential ▪ All controls for routes are done in the ADMX ▪ Edge devices of TDM are transparent and all signals are pre-charged onto TDM ports in their assigned locations • As a result, all non-IP based Destinations will perform clean failovers • The content is being received by the A-LINK at all times ▪ There is script to re-route ingress/egress ports from the PRI/SEC HUBs TDM Signal Switching Company Confidential ▪ Audio gateway for IP translation to/from TDM interfaces for existing EMR audio systems as well as new EMR audio router installations ▪ Can be used for IP audio conversion including AES67 to 302M ▪ Audio Selector feature allows this device to be a hub to aggregate and select any audio on a mono basis ▪ Provides a gateway to link into IP infrastructures as well as efficiently tielines routers together 570EMR-AG-HUB Company Confidential ▪ Applications include: • Bulk audio connections between audio systems such as connecting multiple mobile broadcast vehicles using EMR audio router modules • Audio bridging between devices supporting 302M or AES67 to EMR/EQX routing systems • Mono audio selection of any audio to any audio • AES67 to AES67 profile grooming • IP audio routing for radio using Evertz IP switches • Optimized for operation in a 10Gbe and 25Gbe IP SDVN environment Applications Company Confidential ▪ Audio gateway of external TDM signals into IP (Studer, Calrec, EMR) ▪ IP conversion between ST302 and AES67 ▪ AES67 to AES67 for profile grooming ▪ ST302M: maximum of 512 multicasts per port ▪ AES67: maximum of 512 multicasts per port ▪ 8 TMD in, 8 TDM out (512 channels per TDM) ▪ 10x10 MADI as a license option ▪ Audio Selector as a license option ▪ Pop Suppression as a license option Features & Benefits Company Confidential ▪ TDM Audio I/O • Connectors: DIN 1.0/2.3 • Max Audio Channels per TDM: 512 ▪ Ethernet Interface • Connectors: 4 SFP+ • Standards: ST302M/AES67 ▪ Reference • Input: Analog 525 or 625 • Connector: DIN 1.0/2.3 (contact factory for other options) Specs Company Confidential ▪ This page contains the essential configuration parameters for the module including: • Viewing the Proxy address • Data Port IP addresses (Magnum-SDVN to set) • Inband Control multicasts Web Interface – System Page Company Confidential ▪ This page displays the presence of the audio channels on each link ▪ Additionally, audio pop status can be viewed for each channel on each link Web Interface – Signal Input Company Confidential ▪ This page configures the IP output values for 302M audio including: • Output address range for each link • Multicast address to associate to the output transport streams on each link • This will be assigned by Magnum- SDVN on initial connection to the device Web Interface – IP Output (S302M) Company Confidential ▪ This page configured the IP output values for AES67 audio including: • Output address range for each link • Multicast address to associate to the output transport streams on each link • This will be assigned by Magnum- SDVN on initial connection to the device Web Interface – IP Output (AES67) Company Confidential ▪ This page configured the IP input values for 302M audio including: • Input address range for each link • Multicast address to receive the input transport streams on each link • This will be assigned by Magnum- SDVN as routes are made to the 302M inputs on the module Web Interface – IP Input (S302M) Company Confidential ▪ This page configured the IP input values for AES67 audio including: • Input address range for each link • Multicast address to receive the input transport streams on each link • This will be assigned by Magnum- SDVN as routes are made to the AES67 inputs on the module Web Interface – IP Input (AES67) Company Confidential ▪ This page selects the type of input source for a signal and the output mode ▪ The Channel presence can be viewed under Channel Monitoring for each channel on each link. Web Interface – Signal Output Company Confidential ▪ This page allows the user to configure the audio delays either globally or per stream Web Interface – Delay Control Company Confidential ▪ This page allows the user to configure the incoming PCR signal • Additionally the PCR signal can be output from the card and sent to other devices Web Interface – PCR Control Company Confidential ▪ This page allows the user to configure the incoming PTP signal • PTP is required to be present when using ST 2110 for the audio on the card Web Interface – PTP Control Company Confidential ▪ All routing for AG-HUB breakaway audio must be done in Magnum-ClientHost in the virtual page ▪ If you route physical in ClientHost or SDVN breakaway capabilities for that destination will be broken • To recover this we would need to rebuild the TDM-TS paths Routing","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
