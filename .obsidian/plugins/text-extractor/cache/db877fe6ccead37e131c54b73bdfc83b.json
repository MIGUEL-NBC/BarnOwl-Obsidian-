{"path":"PDF Library/Remote Support Documents/Telemetrics/Telemetrics remote sign out note.docx","text":"Received a few reports regarding the Robo Telemetrics panels becoming unavailable/offline because users are remotely exiting the software. When the Telemetrics interface is exited (Not Remote Desktop), the units are not able to be dialed into and someone onsite must boot the panels manually. In order to prevent this from happening, please make sure remote operators do NOT click “Exit” on the homepage. In order for Remote Ops to properly disconnect form the remote Telemetrics interface/session, you must close out the Windows Remote Desktop software ONLY. You can do this by either clicking the “X” on the top blue Remote Desktop bar or by clicking “X” on the top right of the Remote Desktop software window.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
