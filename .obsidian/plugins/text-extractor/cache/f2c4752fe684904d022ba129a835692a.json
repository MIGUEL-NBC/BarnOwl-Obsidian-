The camera has a compact, box-shaped case, so it requires little space for installation and can be used for a variety of applications. A camera control system that uses the same protocol as a HDC studio camera is employed, allowing the camera to be used for system operation in combination with a multi-camera studio system. Features High picture quality and high performance The latest 2/3-type Progressive IT CCD units for 2,200,000 pixels achieve high sensitivity and low smear. In addition, the 14-bit A/D converter and an original developed signal processing LSI provide high picture quality of optimal grade. Multiple formats The camera covers 1080/59.94i, 720/59.94P, 1080/50i, and 720/50P. Furthermore, it incorporates a down-converter to also enable SD operation. Same control system as HDC1000R series The use of the same controller as the HDC1000R series means it is possible to build a system with a command network unit and LAN. Compact, box-shaped case Operation in various situations is made possible by a compact, light case that is 86 mm slim. ND/CC dual optical servo filters mounted The compact case incorporates ND/CC dual optical servo filters. Auto Lens Aberration Compensation function The Auto Lens Aberration Compensation function (ALAC) is provided with this camera. This automatically reduces chromatic aberration of magnification when a lens that supports auto aberration compensation is attached. For details on lenses supporting auto aberration compensation, contact a Sony sales representative or Sony service representative. Image Inverter function The camera comes standard with an image inverter function for inverting the top/bottom and left/right of the image. If an image is inverted by, for example, half mirroring for 3D shooting, this function can be used to restore the image inside the camera. Focus assist functions The VF detail function and focus assist indicator function facilitate focusing. VF detail Various functions are provided for the VF detail signal, which can be added only on images on the monitor screen in order to facilitate focusing in various situations: Functions for coloring the VF detail signal, flickering the VF detail signal by adding modulation and automatically compensating the VF detail level according to the zoom position. Focus Assist Indicator The focusing level indicator is displayed on an external monitor to provide a guide for focusing. The best focus setting can be easily determined by using the fluctuation of the level indicator as a guide. The focus assist functions can be used when a monitor is connected to the SDI 2 connector and camera output is set to HD-SDI. For details on the adjustment, see “Setting the Focus Assist Function” (page 14). “Memory Stick Duo” operation The camera is equipped with a “Memory Stick Duo” slot, which enables setup data storage and software upgrading using a “Memory Stick Duo.” Various color-reproduction functions Selection of multiple gamma tables Seven types of standard and four types of hyper gamma tables are provided with this camera. The hyper gamma values enable cinema-like image creations with wide dynamic range, which are different from those achieved with conventional video gamma. Multimatrix color correction In addition to the standard 6-axis matrix function, the camera has a multimatrix function that permits you to adjust the hue and chroma for color components in 16-axis directions independently. This is quite useful in color matching among multiple cameras. Knee saturation Change of hue and decrease in chroma that occur in highlighted areas can be compensated. This enables reproduction of natural skin tones under strong lighting. Low key saturation Chroma in low-key zones can be compensated. Thus, compensation for color reproduction in all zones is enabled in combination with matrix color compensation and knee saturation functions. Versatile detail control functions Skin-tone detail function This function allows control (emphasis or suppression) of the detail level for just a certain hue or chroma area in an image containing, for example, skin tones. Knee Aperture function This function emphasizes detail in highlighted portions. 5Overview Detail boost-frequency control The boost frequency can be adjusted from 20 to 30 MHz. This allows the detail thickness to be set appropriately for the subject, thus enabling more subtle image expression. H/V ratio control The ratio between horizontal and vertical detail can be adjusted. White/black limiter The white and black details can be limited independently. Easy menu-based setting Selections and settings for camera status items, safety-zone marker 1) or center marker,2) screen size marker, etc. can be made quickly and easily, using setup menus displayed on the monitor. 1) Safety zone marker: A box-shaped marker displayed on the external monitor screen which indicates 80%, 90%, 92.5%, or 95% of the total screen area 2) Center marker: A cross-shaped marker which indicates the center of the external monitor screen The functions that are displayed differ depending on the output settings.

Setting the Focus Assist Function Using the OPERATION menu, the assist functions for easier focusing on the monitor screen can be activated. When using the focus assist functions, connect a monitor to the SDI 2 connector and set camera output to HD-SDI. For details on the adjustment, see “Setting the Camera Outputs” (page 12). Adding a VF detail signal Adding a VF detail signal to sharp edges in the image on the monitor screen makes it easier to check the focusing condition by observing changes in the detail signal or in the color converted from the detail signal (color detail). The focus setting where the detail signal becomes strongest is the best focus setting. 1 Turn on the camera. 2 Set the DISPLAY/MENU switch to MENU while holding the menu control knob pressed. The camera enters Menu mode, and “TOP” is displayed at the upper right corner of the screen.

If you shoot a scene that includes a laser beam, be careful not to let a laser beam become directed into the lens of the camera. Do not subject to severe shocks Damage to the case or internal components may result. When finished using Set the power switch to OFF. Operation and storage environment Store in a level place with air conditioning. If the unit gets wet, make sure it is completely dry before storage. Avoid use or storage in the following places: • Extremely hot or cold places • Places with high humidity • Places with strong vibration • Near strong magnetic fields • In places where it receives much direct sunlight, or near heating equipment Condensation If you move the camera from a very cold place to a warm place, or use it in a damp location, condensation may form on the lens or inside the camera. The camera has no built-in condensation indicator. If you find condensation on the body or lens, switch the camera off and wait for the condensation to disappear for about one hour. Phenomena specific to CCD image sensors The following phenomena that may appear in images are specific to CCD (Charge Coupled Device) image sensors. They do not indicate malfunctions. White flecks Although the CCD image sensors are produced with high- precision technologies, fine white flecks may be generated on the screen in rare cases, caused by cosmic rays. This is related to the principle of CCD image sensors and is not a malfunction. The white flecks especially tend to be seen • when operating at a high environmental temperature • when you have raised the master gain (sensitivity) This product has a compensation function and the problem may be alleviated by automatic black balance adjustment. Smear When an extremely bright object, such as a strong spotlight or flashlight, is being shot, vertical tails may be produced on the screen, or the image may be distorted. Aliasing When fine patterns, stripes, or lines are shot, they may appear jagged or flicker. Error Messages If a problem occurs during operation, a warning message is displayed on the monitor. To display a message, set the DISPLAY/MENU switch to DISPLAY or MENU. Using a “Memory Stick Duo” You can use “Memory Stick Duo” media with the unit. When a “Memory Stick Duo” is inserted in the camera, the file data can be stored on the “Memory Stick Duo,” which enables you to share data among cameras. Unit operations have been checked using “Memory Stick Duo” media up to 16 GB. Only a “Memory Stick” of Duo size can be used with the camera. Note Message Meaning TEMP WARNING The internal temperature is extraordinarily high. FAN STOP The built-in fan is not rotating properly. SET SYSTEM CLOCK The time/date of the internal clock have not been set. OHB BLOCK NG! A problem is detected in the optical block. MSU RPN BUSY RPN compensation was attempted using the camera menu while being operated from an external device. Consult Sony service personnel. VF RPN BUSY RPN compensation was attempted from an external device while being operated using the camera menu. Consult Sony service personnel. NO MEMORY STICK A “Memory Stick” operation was attempted with no “Memory Stick Duo” in the slot. MEMORY STICK ERROR An error occurred during access to a “Memory Stick Duo.” FORMAT ERROR! A “Memory Stick” operation was attempted with an unformatted “Memory Stick Duo.” MEMORY STICK LOCKED File writing was attempted with a write- protected “Memory Stick Duo.” FILE ERROR An error occurred while reading a file from a “Memory Stick Duo.” OTHER MODEL’S FILE You attempted to read a file of other models having no compatibility. FILE NOT FOUND The file you attempted to read does not exist in the “Memory Stick Duo.” Note 30 Appendices Inserting a “Memory Stick Duo” Insert a “Memory Stick Duo” with the label side facing left into the “Memory Stick Duo” slot until it clicks and the access lamp lights in red. When the “Memory Stick Duo” is properly set, the lamp lights in green. If it does not fit into the slot properly or if there is some resistance when you insert it, the “Memory Stick Duo” may be turned around or upside-down. Do not force the “Memory Stick Duo” into the slot. Confirm the direction of the notch and arrow on the “Memory Stick Duo” before inserting the “Memory Stick Duo,” and then try inserting it again. Removing a “Memory Stick Duo” Confirm that the access lamp is not lit in red, then lightly push in the “Memory Stick Duo” to release the lock. If the access lamp is lit in red, data is being read from or written to the “Memory Stick Duo” At this time, do not shake the product or subject it to shock. Do not turn off the power to the product or remove the “Memory Stick Duo.” Doing so may damage the data. Protecting saved data To prevent accidental erasure of important setup data, use the LOCK switch on the “Memory Stick Duo.” Slide the switch upward to the write protect position. This ensures that you cannot inadvertently overwrite data on the “Memory Stick Duo.” The “Memory Stick Duo” does not have a LOCK switch. When using “Memory Stick Duo” media, be careful not to inadvertently overwrite or erase your data. Precautions • Do not attach anything other than the supplied label to the “Memory Stick Duo” labeling position. • Attach the label so that it does not stick out beyond the labeling position. • Carry and store the “Memory Stick Duo” in its case. • Do not touch the connector of the “Memory Stick Duo” with anything, including your finger or metallic objects. • Do not strike, bend, or drop the “Memory Stick Duo.” • Do not disassemble or modify the “Memory Stick Duo.” • Do not allow the “Memory Stick Duo” to get wet. • Do not use or store the “Memory Stick Duo” in a location that is: — Extremely hot, such as in a car parked in the sun — Under direct sunlight — Very humid or subject to corrosive substances • To prevent data loss, make backups of data frequently. In no event will Sony be liable for any loss of data. • Unauthorized recording may be contrary to the provisions of copyright law. When you use a “Memory Stick Duo” that has been pre-recorded, be sure that the material has been recorded in accordance with copyright and other applicable laws.
