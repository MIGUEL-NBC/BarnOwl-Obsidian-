Mukherjee 7.5.2021 1 Vinten Robo Fusion Ice Mint target troubleshoot 4S Vinten Robo Troubleshooting Guide This guide is intended as a tool to help you troubleshoot Vinten robotic systems throughout the building. This is not specific to any one studio or control type but rather a generic guide for our robotic systems. This guide isn’t meant to hold your hand but rather remind you of tools and steps you can take to solve your issue. I. The tools a. Servers i. Robo servers are all located in 7N. The list for all robo details can be found here. This can be also found on sharepoint. By utilizing a server you can eliminate the need to manually connect to a robo during initial basic troubleshooting. b. ICE Tool i. This tool allows you to connect to a Robo ped directly bypassing the server. This is very useful in that it gives you more detail with errors as well as basic status readouts. It also allows you to enable, target, move the ped as well as adjust the ped configs. c. MintWorkbench i. This tool allows you to connect to the processor in the ped itself and see a real- time reading of what its seeing. This can help you determine targeting issues and other control failures. This tool is used most often with vendor support and you will need to use a USBA-B cable and locally plug into the front of the ped on the control box. d. Fusion set up and Test. i. This tool allows you to control and test the ped directly through USB connection in the front of the system. This allows you to test the ped functionality. II. ICE Tool a. The ICE tool is your best friend when it comes to robo issues. You can connect using the ICE Tool in 2 ways. i. Option 1, Locally at the camera 1. To connect locally, set your laptop IP to the range of the camera denoted on the side of the head. On the base on the back of the camera there is a network switch. It is labeled as to which cable is which. Remove the first cable labeled floor and replace that with the cable connected to your laptop. You should now have communication with that ped and that ped alone via your laptop. ii. Option 2, remotely through a server 1. To connect remotely which can be useful for a quick status check or status updates while operator remains in control. To do this, using the robo details spreadsheet find the IP for the server of the studio you are troubleshooting. Use a jumpbox to remote in using the credentials in the sheet. Since the server is already networked to the peds, you can just open up ice tool and find the ped you want to work on. iii. Connecting to a PED 1. Open ICE Tool in Technician Mode, password is spanner A. Mukherjee 7.5.2021 2 Vinten Robo Fusion Ice Mint target troubleshoot 4S 2. In order to actually connect and control/configure a ped you must first add the ped as a host. To do this, in the ribbon bar select System>Add Host. Using the IP as a reference add the ped you want to control in the window that pops up. This will open up a tab under system that you can open to find the ped and all of its components. Green is good, Orange means its starting/stopping, red means stopped. You can right click and stop and start components. 3. RCU – The RCU component is the main one you will need for most of the work with the ped. In here you can do all the testing and configs for the ped. This is also where you will see more in-depth errors when there is an error on the client-side software. III. The Head and Ped a. When you control a ped, you are controlling the head, which has the ped set up a slave. So, when say swapping peds, if you keep the same head you will not have control conflicts when grabbing a camera through the server. If you need to swap the head, you can remove the daughterboard which lives in the head on the left side by the I/O, two allen screws to remove the cover plate. The daughterboard is what is programmed to be identified with a specific IP. You can either swap this board or connect to the new head and reprogram it to the correct IP. b. Emergency Stops i. These buttons are hard to visually identify if pressed. Twist to unlock. If the button breaks, we cannot replace them ourselves. We have tried you need to disassemble everything to do so. If a button is engaged or incorrectly reading as engaged, you will not be able to control the ped. c. Bumper Contact stop i. If there is enough contact to trigger this sensor you will not be able to control the camera. You should see a red light on the back right of the ped when this happens. Click the light to clear the sensor. d. Auto Manual switch. Located on bottom right. Needs to be in auto for robo control and manual for everything else e. Crab-Steer i. Crab is the default state. Cannot use steer and operator robotically. Steer is used to lock 1 wheel in place and allows you to rotate the base. This should never really be needed to do, as rotating the base can throw off the X/Y control direction. f. Air i. Yes, these peds take air. To fill rotate the center circular plate on the ped until a window lines up with a gauge. Use the gauge as a reference to fill the ped. If ped is undergassed you will get an error saying so in ICE tool. g. Height buttons i. When the ped is in manual mode you can use the buttons on the back of the ped on the column base to manually adjust the height up or down A. Mukherjee 7.5.2021 3 Vinten Robo Fusion Ice Mint target troubleshoot 4S h. Skirt, the skirt helps prevent the ped from running over anything that can damage the wheels. You can raise the skirt by applying pressure upwards. To later drop the skirt, you can hit the 4 circular buttons on the front and rear of the bumpers. i. Control Box i. The control box is in the bumper on the front of the ped. To remove this you will need to full drop the skirt and then loosen the 2 screws on the front. Then applying force using a screwdriver as leverage if needed you can pop out the box. There will be connectors holding it in place. j. Cable release i. There is a cable release switch on the side of the ped. Releasing this will release the ped from the motor turning it into a normally operated manual air ped. The motor works as a winch to keep the ped at a set height. When releasing you must be locked all the way down to prevent damage to the ped and yourself. k. Targeting i. Targeting sensors are located on the sides of the ped. To target you must program the sensors to off and on conditions. Instructions are written on the sensor. l. Robo lens control i. The lens is controlled robotically using a control block under the head. This is connected to the lens. There are different cable types for different lenses and can be a potential gotcha when dealing with lens control issues. m. Head removal i. To remove a head you must raise the ped so you can see underneath. There will be 4 big flathead screws that you can use a big flathead or a wrench to loosen. n. Head power i. Make sure head is powered on as it can be easy to see the ped on and think everything is powered on. IV. Basic Troubleshooting a. If an issue exists from workstation but not through icetool, issue is likely with server. It is a common occurrence to see no issues with control for some peds while having no control with another, this is still a server issue and a reset of the server will resolve. b. If an issue exists from workstation and ice tool issue is likely with the ped. c. When grabbing cameras use the color of the camera as an indication of status. Black means no communication, white means its enabled and ready to grab, green means in control. Brown means while the ped is communicating it either needs to still be enabled or there is something triggering the ped to not switch over to auto mode. Check estops bumper sensor auto/manual switches and any locks. d. To determine if an issue is with the ped or the head you can set the operating mode between slave and none, this will allow you to ignore the ped and only control the head. If you can enable and control freely then you are likely dealing with a ped issue. If still no control, then you have a head issue. This can help save time when first having to determine where an issue might be after you have narrowed the issue down to the ped itself and not the server. A. Mukherjee 7.5.2021 4 Vinten Robo Fusion Ice Mint target troubleshoot 4S Unfortunately, there is too much material and tons of unknown material to make a more comprehensive guide. The notes here are what I have learned through trial and error and what I have been able to learn from the vendors when working with them. That being said, this is by no means a comprehensive fix all guide. I hope this helped you in some way, and if there are any tips or tricks you would like added please let me know.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
