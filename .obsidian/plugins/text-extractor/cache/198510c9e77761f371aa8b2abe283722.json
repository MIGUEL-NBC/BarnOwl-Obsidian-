Slide 1 Where are we today in the broadcast world, and more importantly how did we get here? Traditional broadcast methods are linear, you attach a BNC cable and you can trace the signal because its one directional, it’s copper. With this it is easy to determine if there was a signal one the cable. Beyond that, each piece of equipment was allocated to do a certain function and only perform that function, reducing the amount of tracing required to find the problem. When there were errors you could trace your way backwards down the path and determine where things went wrong. Connections were hard wired to the devices and it was simple, broadcast liked the simplicity. With the change in video formats we require more and more bandwidth. With 4K video being the next direction we see approaching we need to think about the bandwidth requirements and how we will transfer the 12Gb/s that is required for true 4K video. To keep up with the changes in video bandwidth requirements we have moved to we have switched to an IP delivery system. IP delivery isn’t a new idea, it’s a method we have been using for a long time, especially in file based workflows. Even video over IP isn’t new, YouTube and similar channels where you can watch TV and movies online have been around for a long time. So what is the difference then between YouTube video over IP and video over IP in the broadcast studio, video quality. The most important question is what is driving this change? The periods of time between format changes have become shorter and short. To keep up with the format changes broadcasters had to replace infrastructure over and over again and their equipment went out of date. As we transition towards 4K and 8K, the need for the entire infrastructure to change is very real. To transmit 4K the broadcasters require 12 GB/s for each signal. If you have a 576x576 router and you would like to run only 4K signals through it, you would effectively be reducing the size of your router to 144x144 as it required 4 3G cables per 4K signal. In the baseband world, routing in 4K results in an explosive amount of cables and is not feasible for the broadcast facility. The move to an IP facility makes 4K attainable for broadcasters. Understanding the necessity of IP is only part of this. To successfully be able to move to IP, we need to fully understand and explore the challenges IP poses that we never faced in a baseband world. So what are the challenges? The biggest challenge is Broadcasters themselves. Broadcasters are used to having end to end control of their signal; if it gets lost they can go to the copper wire and test for the signal. When the signal moves through a router, they know exactly what path it takes in a baseband world; the IP world doesn’t provide this clear path typically which adds fear of lack of reliability. Additionally, baseband is easy to troubleshoot and broadcasters already know how to work with it, moving to the IP world means broadcasters have to learn how their facility works all over again. Regardless of the challenges, Broadcasters ask themselves how many times do I want to rebuild my facility? The requirements for video are changing at such a rapid pace, that the baseband world will not be able to keep up. Broadcasters wanted to future proof, so they asked for the best ideas on how to do this, Evertz came back with IP. IP technology isn’t new, we have been doing it for years with YouTube, streaming of movies and television. What’s the problem with how we did IP before? In a typical video over IP system videos have buffering to allow them to play in your machine. Other solutions have been point-to-point networks where you don’t have to worry about joining videos at the end, but this is unrealistic in a large facility. Evertz has been learning how to work in the IP realm for over 12 years. Slide 2 So where do we start to begin to understand this new world? The beginning, let’s begin by understanding what a network is. A network is a set of hardware devices connected together, either physically or logically. This allows them to exchange information. Slide 3 “The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.” This phrase describes networking very well and explains why networking has become so popular. A network is more than a bunch of computers with wires running between them, it is a system that provides its users with capabilities beyond what the individual machines can provide. Most of the benefits of networking can be divided into two basic categories: connectivity and sharing. If you were to take a whole bunch of computers, connect them together and say that’s a lot of power, you would be correct. By adding the pieces together the individual pieces become stronger, because they leverage the capabilities of each other. A network isn’t just a bunch of computers with wires running between them. Properly implemented, a network is a system that provides its users with unique capabilities, above and beyond what the individual machines and their software applications can provide. You can leverage not only the physical capabilities of other machines in a properly implemented network, but you can leverage the software capabilities too The NSA uses bulk computing to try to crack codes. At a high level, networks are advantageous because they allow computers and people to be connected together so that they can share resources. Some of the specific benefits of networking include: communication, data sharing, data security and management and application performance enhancement. Slide 4 At a high level, networks are advantageous because they allow computers and people to be connected together so that they can share resources. Networking provides many benefits to the workflow including communication between different parties spread throughout a company or throughout the world. It enables data sharing, and makes data security and management easy. Slide5 The first key term we will look at is Standard Ethernet (10Mb). Standard Ethernet or 10Base-T operates over twister pair Cat 3 or Cat 5 cables. The twist in the cables, hence the term “twisted pair” is designed to prevent crosstalk and RF interference between the pairs, to ultimately enhance the operation of the cable. Standard Ethernet provides basic transmission rates for half-duplex and full-duplex networks. You may be asking yourself, what are half duplex and full duplex. Half duplex, means that the cable is bi-directional by nature, however it can only utilize one direction at a time when passing data. Put more simply, it can only transmit if it is not receiving and it can only receive when it is not transmitting. Full Duplex means that the cable is bi-directional and can both transmit and receive data simultaneously. Slide6 The next type of cable is Fast Ethernet (100Mb). Fast Ethernet or 100Base-TX also operates over twisted pair Cat 5 or Cat 5e cable, the “e” represents enhanced. On the Fast Ethernet cable, the twist is also designed to prevent crosstalk and RF interference between the pairs. Fast Ethernet is the most commonly available and used form of Ethernet. Fast Ethernet is still a cooper connection like Standard Ethernet, however it is a bit faster. Slide7 Then, we come to Gigabit Ethernet, also referred to as simply GigE. GigE is taking over for LAN standards, as the cable type of choice. GigE delivers one billion bits per second, significantly more than its 10Base or 100Base-T predecessors. GigE is typically carred over optical fiber, or sometimes over short-haul copper cables. GigE supports both half and full duplex mode. Slide8 Finally, we’ve reached 10 Gigabit Ethernet, commonly referred to as 10GigE. 10GigE supports only full-duplex links, making its bi-directional in nature. 10GigE does not support Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection, unlike early predecessors, meaning you no longer have to worry about longer delays in your signal transmission because all the transmissions have a unique path. 10GigE offers faster, more efficient and less expensive data handling. 10GigE typically uses optical fiber for LANs, WANs and MANs, however there are a few short-haul copper options available as well. Slide9 GigE and 10GigE are not where it ends. The options for 40 Gigabit Ethernet and 100 Gigabit Ethernet are already in the works. Slide10 Optical fiber being the typical choice for 10GE connections and above, it makes sense to take a few moments to look at what Optical fiber is. An optical fiber is a long, thin strand or impurity-free glass which has been designed to be used as a transport medium for data. Typically, a point-to-point fiber optic communication network consists of a transmitter, or a laser which is contained within the SFP. A transport medium which is the optical fiber itself and then a receiver, or a photo-diode which is also contained within the SFP. Typical SFP’s are bi-directional in nature so we have a transmitter and receiver pair on each end, allowing for the data to flow in both directions with the connection of multiple fiber strands. Slide11 There are many advantages provided by optical fiber that are not realized with traditional copper cable networks. Fiber has less signal degradation per meter than copper cable, making the loss of signal quality much less noticeable, if at all, than in a copper cable network. Optical fiber has a higher signal carry capacity and more bandwidth than traditional copper cable. There are copper options that support 10GE however these can only be used to move your signal over a short distance. Fiber is less costly per meter than copper cabling, as well as lighter and thinner than copper wire. Optical fiber cannot be affected by electromagnetic interference, so poor weather will never affect the signal. Optical transmitters have a lower launching power than copper. As well, optical fiber is flexible and is often used in medical and mechanical imaging systems for that reason. Slide12 Caring for your optical fibers is critical to realizing all of the benefits of them in your system. Clinical cleanliness of all the fiber connections is crucial to a properly functioning fiber network. A single particle of dust or fingerprint on the glass can scatter enough of the optical power to take the entire link down. When a fiber connector is not in use the tip should always be cover with the dust cap to prevent additional damage to the fiber such as scratches and pits. Pits and scratches on the surface of a connector can migrate to other areas, and even affect the SFP’s when mating occurs, causing further damage to the network. Loops which are too tight can also cause breakage to the fiber or cause the signal to stop mid-transmit due to the angle of the fiber. Slide13 SFP’s are designed for optical communication between equipment and devices. They are essential to the flow of information between the edge devices and the core. There are many different types of SFP’s which can house the different connector types to meet the needs of the system. They come in a range of bandwidths: 1Gb/s, 10Gb/s, 25Gb/s, 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s. In addition to bandwidth restrictions, SFP’s can also be purchased based on wavelength requirements and distance requirements. Evertz offers: MM (multimode) 850nm and SM (single mode) 1310nm as standard. In addition, for longer reach applications Evertz offers 1550nm SFP’s. Slide14 Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing versus Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing, what is the difference. WDM is a technology which multiplexes a number of optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelength (colours) of laser light. This enables bidirectional communications over one strand of fiber, as well as multiplication of capacity. CWDM ordering option on SFP’s allows for 8 CWDM wavelengths from 1470 to 1610nm. DWDM ordering option on SFP’s allows for 40 DWDM wavelengths available from channel 20 to channel 59. Slide15 1GE/10G/25G/40G/100G are all terms that describe the speed of a connection. Speed is the most generic performance term used in networking. As such, it can mean just about anything. Most commonly, however, it refers to the rated or nominal speed of a particular networking technology. Speed ratings such as 100 Mbps Ethernet are also often referred to as the throughput. Slide16 Throughput is a measure of how much actual data can be sent per unit of time across a network, channel, or interface. While throughput can be a theoretical term like bandwidth, it is more often used in a practical sense—for example, to measure the amount of data actually sent across a network in the real world. Slide17 Bandwidth is a widely used term that usually refers to the data-carrying capacity of a network or data-transmission medium. It indicates the maximum amount of data that can pass from one point to another in a unit of time. The term comes from the study of electromagnetic radiation, where it refers to the width of a band of frequencies used to carry data. Slide18 How do Speed, Bandwidth and Throughput relate to each other? The term speed is the most generic and often refers to the rated or nominal speed of a networking technology. Bandwidth can mean either the width of a frequency band used by a technology or more generally, data capacity, where it's used as more of a theoretical measure. Throughput is a specific measure of how much data flows over a channel in a given period of time. It is usually a practical measurement. Slide19 In networking, Latency is a very important, often overlooked term, which refers to the timing of data transfers on a communications channel or network. One important aspect of latency is how long it takes from the time a request for data is made until it starts to arrive. Another aspect is how much control a device has over the timing of the data that is sent, and whether the network can be arranged to allow for the consistent delivery of data over a period of time. Low latency is considered better than high latency. Slide20 There are three basic operating modes that describe how data is sent between connected devices on a network. This describes the kind of cabling that will be used for the network connections as the operating modes are dependent on the type of cabling used. In a simplex operation, data can flow in only one direction between two devices. Half-duplex networks allow any device to transmit, but only one may do so at a time. Full-duplex operation means two attached devices can each transmit and receive simultaneously. The latter offers the greatest potential performance, because forcing one device to wait for another before sending data does not decrease throughput. Slide21 It is important to understand the characteristics of how data is transmitted in a network and not just how quickly it is transmitted. These characteristics are categorized with two unique terms: Quality of Service and Best Effort. Quality of Service, commonly called QoS, refers to resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. QoS is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. For example, a required bit rate, delay, jitter, packet dropping probability and/or bit error rate may be guaranteed. Quality of service guarantees are important if the network capacity is insufficient, especially for real-time streaming multimedia applications Slide22 The other type of network is a Best Effort network. A best-effort network or service does not support quality of service, instead it tries to guarantee connectivity based on the provisioned amount that has been allocated for the information. However sometimes it will result in a situation where the network is over-provisioned and not all the information can travel, this type of network is not conducive to a broadcast network. An alternative to complex QoS control mechanisms is to provide high quality communication over a best-effort network by over-provisioning the capacity so that it is sufficient for the expected peak traffic load.The resulting absence of network congestion eliminates the need for QoS mechanisms… in theory!","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
