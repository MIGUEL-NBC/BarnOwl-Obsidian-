But once we completed, we immediately noticed a bunch of errors in Driver Logs. We have seen these errors in the past cause performance issues with ITXE Procing and Control, so we reverted back to the original ITXE Driver, which removed the errors. We tested control across MTC of the REMs just to be sure and we ended the work window for the night. Will address this Driver issue with Evertz R&D in the morning and look to early next week to finish deployment of the Unity Feature. Please be aware again of any odd reports and let us know.
