The firmware upgrade was done to fully resolve an outstanding EXE Frame Controller software bug. This same bug is related to the November 16th Outage that we had across the IP Control Rooms on the PROD-EXE. Now that ACQ is complete, we plan to rollout this same firmware upgrade to the PROD-EXE this Sunday night. Please be aware of any odd reports from the MTC/SatOps Team and let us know if anything pops up. Trevor Bascomb NBCUniversal Manager, Production Systems Engineering","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
