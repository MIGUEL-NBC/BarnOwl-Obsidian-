DVP-30A BoardThe DVP-30A board consists of a control block and a signal processing block.The control block consists of the sub CPU A (CPU-DR or CPU-DT) and the sub CPU B (CPU-DR or CPU-DT).Each sub CPU receives commands from the main CPU (CA-54CFC board) through the Dual Port RAM (IC1101, 1201) to control the signal processing block through the boot PLD (IC108).The FPGAs of both sub CPUs are controlled through the FPGA IF (IC107).Whether to choose sub CPU A or sub CPU B to perform the processing depends on the type of effect.These sub CPUs start up by booting the flash memory in the module, and then run the applications upon the second boot of the booting flash memory (IC1301, 1302) on this board.The boot PLD performs configuration of the other FPGAs on this board using the address decoding to the peripheral devices of the sub CPUs and the configuration data stored in the configuration flash memory (IC1303, 1304) under the control of the sub CPU A.Configuration data and applications to be stored in the flash memory are refreshed during the installation performed by the compact flash card of the main CPU.The signal processing block comprises five FPGAs: Pre Video Modify (PVM), Filter (FILTER), Address Generator (ADRS), Interpolator (INTP), and Mixer (MIX).The short names in parentheses ( ) are used in the description below.The respective FPGAs have the following main functions.(1) PVM (IC1)· Border/crop/beveled edge· Video modify (posterization, solarization, mosaic, etc.)· Input freeze· Mask key generation(2) FILTER (IC2)· Antialias filter (horizontal/vertical directions)· Scan conversion· Field/frame conversion· Defocus/blur· Through image processing for mask(3) ADRS (IC3)· 3D linear transform· Non-linear processing(4) INTP (IC4)· Interpolation· Lighting(5) MIX (IC5)· Recursive processing (single channel)The signal flows are as follows:The video and key signals of the main signal line are transmitted using the LVDS technology from the VIF-32 board to the LVDS receivers (IC1901 to 1903), and are then sent to PVM.In PVM, the video/key signals receive input freeze, video modify, and border/crop/beveled edge processing using the DDR SDRAM (IC2301, 2302), and are then transferred to FILTER.In FILTER, the signals receive filtering (antialias filter) in accordance with the defocus/blur in the horizontal direction first and with the reduction ratio.Then the signals receive re-arrangement (scan conversion) using the DDR SDRAM (IC2401, 2402), and also receive defocus/blur in the vertical direction and antialias filtering.The signals further receive Field/Frame Conversion using the DDR SDRAM (IC2501, 2502). The output data is sent to INTP to be stored in the ZBT SRAM.In ADRS, addresses for 3D linear transform and non-linear addresses are generated and transferred to INTP.In INTP, data is read from the ZBT SRAM at the address determined by ADRS, and the internal insertion processing is performed.The video and key signals to which interpolation processing has been applied are sent to MIX for lighting mixture using the light key generated by INTP.In MIX, recursive processing using the DDR SDRAM (IC3401, 3402) is performed for the video/key signals for programs to be transmitted to the VIF-32 board from the LVDS transmitters (IC2201 to 2203) using the LVDS technology.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
