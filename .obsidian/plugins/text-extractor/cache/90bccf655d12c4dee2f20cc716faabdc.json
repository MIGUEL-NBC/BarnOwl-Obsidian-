{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Studio Maintenance - Graphics Documentation/VizRt Data Hub.docx","text":"VizRt Data Hub We are working with Vizrt to solve an ongoing issue where Data Hub will stop functioning. As of today, the only thing Data Hub is used for is to feed the 1A outside wall monitors with social media data. When the Data Hub stops functioning, social media feeds to these monitors stop, and the graphics are blank. Until Vizrt provides a long-term fix for these problems, here is how to troubleshoot and resolve said issue. VNC to 100.113.83.236 Launch the Feed Streamer shortcut on the desktop. If the app eventually loads with sources (upper-left) present, the Data Hub is working, and the problem is elsewhere. Please be a little patient here, as loading can take 60 seconds or more. This is what Feed Streamer looks like after loading, and me clicking on today-hashtag-battle â€“ this is what we want to see: If Feed Streamer launches, but eventually gives you a 'cannot connect' error, the Data Hub indexes need to be rebuilt. To rebuild the indexes, close Feed Streamer. On the desktop, launch cleanIndex.bat. This batch file shuts down all Data Hub services, cleans the indexes, then starts everything back up again. Launch Feed Streamer again, make sure Sources are present. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Matt Miller-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
