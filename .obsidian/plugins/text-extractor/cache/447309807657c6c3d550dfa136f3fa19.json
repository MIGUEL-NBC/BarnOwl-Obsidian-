Event Logging Rev 1.0 060915 Page 2 of 24 The SPS-4200 system is composed of a DC21 and the following Windows applications: PLAYLIST CREATOR - The Playlist Creator Windows Application allows a user to easily create playlists without affecting on-air play out. A list can be created from scratch or a pre-existing list can be loaded for OFF-AIR editing. PLAYLIST - The Playlist Windows Application allows for Program and Commercial play out or record on a single video server channel with optional secondary events. The application supports 4 play out / record channels, one playlist per channel. The easy to use User Interface allows a user to view the list of available clips, drag & drop into playlist, change play out order and create & save playlists. Modify the playlist at any time edit, add and delete elements, append playlists even while the list is playing out. DROPBOX - The Dropbox Windows Applications allows an operator to “Drop” a playlist or traffic list into a watched folder on a Windows computer and seconds later see it running on the automation system. The Playlist Windows Application runs on the Playlist Playout computer or any other Windows computer on the network. Simply Drop an updated playlist for today or tomorrow in its respective folder and it will then Automatically transfer to the playout channel with the next element to air cued up. To effectively install the SPS4200 system please setup in the following order: 1. PC CONFIGURATION. 2. DC20 CONFIGRUATION. 3. CONFIGURING CLIP DATABASE ALLOCATION. 4. REBUILDING INGEST DATABASE. Note: GTP-32’s, DC20’s and DC21’s will be referred to as “DC21” for the remainder of this document. Page 3 of 24 PC CONFIGURATION PLAYLIST CREATOR INSTALLATION 1. Create 2 folders on a local PC automation workstation. The first folder will contain the Playlist Creator software along with its configuration files provided by DNF. The second folder will contain the Playlist software along with its configuration files also provided by DNF. 2. Copy the playlister.exe and dnf_config.txt files to the Playlist Creator folder on your PC. NOTE: Playlister.exe may be safely renamed for ease of use. 3. Open the dnf_config.txt file. Edit the config to match the IP address of your DC21. Please edit all lines in the config file to match the DC21’s IP address. Here is an example of the format: CH_1 – CH_4: represent the DC21 playout channels connected to the Video Server. CH_5: represents the DC21 User Registers for secondary events. 4. Once complete, save the changes made to the dnf_config.txt file. Page 4 of 24 PLAYLIST INSTALLATION 1. Copy the playlist.exe and dnf_config.txt files to the Playlist folder on your PC. NOTE: Playlist.exe may be safely renamed for ease of use. 2. Open the dnf_config.txt file. Edit the config to match the IP address of your DC21. Please edit all lines in the config file to match the DC21’s IP address. Here is an example of the format: CH_1 – CH_4: represent the DC21 playlist playout channels. CH_5 – CH_8: represent the DC21 channels we will obtain the cliplist from. Typically these channels will be configured the same as CH 1-4. CH_9: represents the DC21 User Registers for secondary events. 3. Once complete, save the changes made to the dnf_config.txt file. DROPBOX INSTALLATION 1.

Page 11 of 24 Configuring Clip Database Allocation If all channels on a DC20 connect to video server channels that share the same storage, the Clip Database Allocation table needs to be configured for \"Single Shared Database\". Since each channel on the DC20 has the same clip list, the storage is shared, so only one storage is being managed. All of the allotted space to store clipnames are available for use. To configure a “Single Shared Database” 1. Click on the “System” link at the top of the page. The System menu will be displayed. 2. Click on the “Configure Clip Database Allocation” link in the middle of the page. The Clip Database Configuration page will be displayed. 3. Click on the dropdown box in the Clip Database Allocation field and select \"Single Shared Database\". 4. Click on “Save” to save your selection. Reboot the DC20 to finalize If any channel on a DC20 connects to a completely different server than the others, the Clip Database Allocation table needs to be configured as \"4 Independant Database\" or \"8 Independant Database\". Since each channel on the DC20 has independent clip databases a four channel system each one has a quarter the capacity of the \"single\" version For an eight channel system each one has an eight the capacity of the \"single\" version. To configure a “4 independant Database” or \"4 Independant Database\": 1. Click on the “System” link at the top of the page. The System menu will be displayed. 2. Click on the “Configure Clip Database Allocation” link in the middle of the page. The Clip Database Configuration page will be displayed. 3. Click on the dropdown box in the Clip Database Allocation field and select \"4 Independant Database\". 4. Click on “Save” to save your selection. Reboot the DC20 to finalize. !!NOTE!! DNF recommends that you configure your DC20 to “\"4 Independant Database\" or \"8 Independant Database\" if you encounter any issue with retreiving the clip list from the server. Page 12 of 24 Rebuilding Ingest Database The rebuild process reads the list of clips on the video server and populates a local Clip Database in the DC21. Once the rebuild process is completed, The DC21 will automatically update the Clip Database as new clips are added to the video server, or existing clips are deleted. If an Ethernet connection to the video server exists the rebuild process will occur immediately after powering up the DC20 Device Controller or when a reconnect to the server occurs. If no Ethernet connection to the video server exists the rebuild process must be performed manually. To manually rebuild: 1. Open the playlist.exe windows application provided to you by DNF. 2. Select the “LIST” tab on the upper left hand corner of the window. 3. Select “Rebuild the clip list”. The Ingest Database only needs to be rebuilt when connecting to a video server for the first time. Page 13 of 24 OPERATION PLAYLIST CREATOR 1. Open the Playlist creator.exe.

Page 22 of 24 DROPBOX APPLICATION CONFIGURATION The DropBox application can manage multiple folders on a single PC. Each folder that will be used must be configured as a separate entry in the list below. For each folder entry, there are 5 fields that must be filled in. All fields are seperated with a comma. Spaces may be used after commas to space out the fields for readability. The entry must follow the following order: <Filename Filter>, <Filename Format>, <Dropbox Folder Path>, <DC20 IP Address>, <DC20 Channel #> Sample Entry: test*.txt, test%m%d%y.txt, C:\\DropBox_Example\\, 192.168.10.217,1 1. <Filename Filter>: This field specifies the filter that will be used to determine if a list should be processed or rejected within that folder. This includes filtering of the filename extension. * is used to specify parts of the name that are not checked for filtering. Example: test*.txt -> The filename must begin with \"test\", and must have the extension \".txt\" Any characters that follow after \"test\" and before the extension will not be checked for filtering. 2. <Filename Format>: This defines the naming convention for a playlist file,including the scheduled date. Use %m to define two characters within the filename format that will be used to determine the month. Use %d to define two characters that will be used to determine the day. Use %y to define two characters that will be used to determine the year. For more information on determining a naming convention, please contact DNF Customer Support. Example: test%m%d%y.txt (This defines the filename format as test<month><day><year>.txt) 3. <DropBox Folder Path>: This defines the location on the local PC that the DropBox folder is kept. Example: C:\\DropBox_Test\\ 4. <DC20 IP Address>: This determines which DC20 the playlist will be updated to when a playlist is processed. Page 23 of 24 5. <DC20 Channel #>: This determines which channel on the DC20, 1 through 4 the playlist will be uploaded to when it is processed. EVENT LOGGING The DropBox application maintains event logs of all activity within the software. The event logs are stored at C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Windows UserName>\\Application Data\\DNF Controls\\dropbox\\event_log. Please include copies of these event logs when reporting technical issues to DNF Controls. Page 24 of 24","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
