The unit enables either 4K or HD IP operations through a single Networked Media Interface (NMI)*, along with SDI outputs. The unit is also HDR (High Dynamic Range) ready** and can handle High Frame Rate (HFR) HD up to 8x slow motion***. The HDCU-4300 combined with the HDC-4300 camera offers OB operators a uniquely flexible, space-saving BPU/CCU for advanced 4K/HD IP operation. * Single NMI is 4K or HD selectable. ** HDR: single output supports ITU BT.2020/S-Log3. *** HFR requires optional software SZC-4002. Highlights * Space-saving compact design gives OB operators more flexibility * 4K or HD IP operations supported * LIVE-HDR ready * Up to 8x slow motion Full HD interlace pictures Features Features Benefits Combined Camera Control Unit (CCU) and baseband processor unit (BPU) with single IP interface The HDCU-4300 is equipped with one IP interface, which enables the IP live production for 4K/HD working with the HDC-4300 4K/HD camera. It can handle broadcast quality HD and 4K video, audio, synchronization signals and control data across the IP network, which increases operational efficiency. While the IP signals are output, the SDI signals can be output from the HDCU-4300 simultaneously in order to integrate the HDCU- 4300 seamlessly with your existing SDI infrastructure. Multi-format functionality The HDCU-4300 has multi-format support for 4K and HD. In 4K, it supports QFHD (3840 x 2160) and 4K Cinema (4096 x 2160) 60p/50p, 30p/25p and 24p. In HD, it supports Full HD (1980 x 1080) 480i/400i, 360i/300 240p/200p, 240i/200i, 180p/150p, 180i/150i, 120p/100p, 120i/100i, 60p/50p, 60i/50i, 30PsF/25PsF, 24PsF. High Frame Rate signal processing to a maximum Full HD 480i/400i (optional software: SZC-4002) The HDCU-4300 supports Full HD High Frame Rate (HFR) capture at 480i/400i 8x slow motion and 360i/300i 6x slow motion, in interlace mode only. The unit also supports Full HD HFR 4x, 3x and 2x slow motion in both progressive and interlace modes. HD cut out functionality (Optional software: SZC- 2001*) It is possible to cut out a Full HD image from the 4K picture in real-time, allowing, for example, for the camera to be in a fixed camera position and operator free giving a wide view of the action, an area of which can be selected by the director.&nbsp; * The option is limited to HD cut-out. 4K signals do not output from the HDCU-4300.
