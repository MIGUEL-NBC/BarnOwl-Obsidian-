Both walls are driven by a single Barco S3 4K Jr. processor. This box is located in 4E IDF, Rack 2. There is also a spare Barco S3 4K Jr., which is located in the same rack. Both boxes are running identical software, have identical hardware, and have identical configurations. In this same rack, there is a jackfield where all connections to and from the Barcos comes to patch. This is useful because it allows for a quick patch to switch either wall to the backup box in case there is an issue with the primary box. In the event that either the North Wall or East Wall need to be switched over to the backup, the following steps should be taken (all patching will be within this one jackfield): Overpatch North LED wall with Spare Barco Patch Primary Barco Input 1 over Spare Barco Input 1 Patch Spare Barco Outputs 1-4 over Primary Barco Outputs 1-4 Overpatch East LED wall with Spare Barco Patch Primary Barco Input 2 over Spare Barco Input 2 Patch Spare Barco Outputs 5-8 over Primary Barco Outputs 5-8 It’s important that only entire walls are overpatched…do NOT patch part of a wall from the Spare Barco. The colors between the two boxes are not 100% identical, so mixing the primary and spare on a single wall will result in mixed colors. Assuming there was an issue with the primary box the resulted in you having to patch in the secondary, you will need to connect to the primary box and restore the saved configuration file to fix whatever the issue may be. While it is possible to do individual adjustments to fix whatever the issue is, the simplest and quickest fix is to just restore the backup config file…it will ensure that the original good configuration is completely restored. It’s important to only do this when the production space is off the air since this will affect both walls regardless of which one may have the actual problem. Download the Event Master software from this folder: Event Master Toolset Rev 4.1 (Build 31772) Setup.exe Install this software on a PC (best bet is to log in to one of the desktops in 4E Production Space so you can work on this in the actual room where the LED walls are). This software will not run on most laptops. Open the Event Master Toolset from the desktop and at the bottom left enter the IP address from the primary Barco: 100.112.239.96. Click Add System. Now click on the gear icon on the top left area: Select Tools: Select Backup and Restore: Drag the restore file to the Restore green Drag N Drop area. The restore files can be found here: 4E Barco Proceed with any prompts asking if you’re sure you want to restore the system. The system will ask if you want to proceed with a restart, which is required to restore the configuration. Proceed. This restart will take approximately 2-3 minutes; during this time, the LED walls may go blue. When the system comes back up, you should be back in a normal configuration on both walls. Occasionally, depending on how the walls come back, one area of the walls may have slightly different brightness. Easiest and quickest fix for this is to power cycle the Extron DVI DA for that section of the wall. The units are all located directly behind the LED tiles. If there is a need to do this restore work on the secondary Barco S3 4K Jr. scaler, its IP is 100.112.239.81. Follow all the same steps, just using the Secondary restore file.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
