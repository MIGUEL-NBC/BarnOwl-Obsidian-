This is why. There exist a standard range of Multicast IP addresses is any network. IP multicast addresses, also known as group addresses, are in the class D range of 224.0. 0.0 to 239.255. 255.255 as defined by setting the first four high order bits to 1110. This range is designated by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) for multicast traffic… Yes, the multicast IP address range limit applies even in internal networks. The multicast range is divided into different blocks, each with its own specific purpose or scope. For example: 224.0.0.0 to 224.0.0.255 are reserved for local network control and maintenance purposes. - 224.0.1.0 to 224.0.1.255 are globally scoped addresses, used for Internet- wide multicasting. - 239.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255 is designated for administrative and local multicast, often used within private networks or organizations. - Within our Evertz workflow: when a computer outputs any visual media (video) it is sent to a corresponding multicast address. These addresses are shared between the Evertz system and the outputting computers (Camera's, Viz Engines, Social Mac's) or can be translated and bridged with NAT (Network Address Translation) Cards. The main point is that the output of the generating computer is the \"source\". That is sent --> to a \"destination\" in this case that's the Multicast IP Address. The Evertz system has access to these \"destinations\" and can route the output of that Multicast IP Address to any other location within it's internal routing. The Multicast IP Addresses are in essence Cable TV Channels and the Evertz system is \"Tuning\" in to watch whatever that channel has scheduled for programming that day. Multicast IP Address // Evertz Routing Conceptual Overview Friday, March 8, 2024 7:07 PM Everything Page 1 programming that day. Here's an example from our system. Imagine Evertz is a kid watching TV on Saturday morning. [Graphics Engine] [Lower Thirds] [Multicast IP Address] DirectTV is playing Looney Tunes on Channel 5. Evertz then \"tunes\" into Channel 5 and now has access to his favorite show Looney Tunes through his TV thanks to DirectTV. Evertz is also a child genius and a kleptomaniac. So he steals that Channels output Looney Tunes, plagiarizes it and then sends it to all of his friends or subscribers TV's on his own Evertz 10GMMA Network. This can also said as: The Graphics Engine (Cable Network) in charge of that Multicast IP Address (Channel) has decided to output Lower Thirds (Show). - That Lower Third is sent in real time to a Multicast \"destination\" IP Address by the Graphics Engine. - Evertz tunes into that Multicast \"destination\" IP Address and accesses the stream and its content before copying it, duplicating it, and sending it along through it's own Media Network. - Similar to Radio Frequencies and human RF receivers, we tune Evertz to the appropriate channel (frequency) and we can then reproduce and route those outputs. This means that the source itself remains unaffected by any issues that happen within the Everts Routing Network. If a stream looks corrupt but the engines is showing no errors then the issue must be downstream of the graphics generator. Since the Destination IP can be thought of as a frequency, the only issue it could pose is whether you are properly tuned to the right station. More simply, if a camera output looks fine for the operator through the viewfinder but not for the video operator on their (working) monitors, the issue is downstream of the source but upstream of the destination.

(Issues could be with the GFX Engines/Cameras/CCU's or with the Evertz devices making up the routes or with the transmission mediums themselves (cables)) Everything Page 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
