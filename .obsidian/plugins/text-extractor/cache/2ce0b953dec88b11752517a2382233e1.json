This Pan/Tilt is designed for use with ENG and smaller type cameras. Due to the different types of cameras and lenses the Pan/Tilt interfaces with, many options are manufactured. Some of those options are described in the following paragraphs. Please consult the factory for the specific options available. 2.0 Introduction The PT-RM-1 is a robotic camera pan/tilt head with smooth variable operating speed. Heavy duty cross roller bearings and swings motors with isolation mounts provide quiet operation. The lens connector provides direct connection and interface to lens functions. Lens interface options are also available. The Pan/Tilt head is powered from the Rack Mount Power Supply PS-RM-48 and converts the 48V to appropriate voltage levels for the head, auxiliary robotics devices, camera, lens and viewfinder. The unit is controlled through serial data interface using RS-232 standard or RS-422 optional. Manual smooth motion is accomplished using velocity servo controls. Sixteen (16) presets are available. Presets are called using shot convergence technology, allowing for smooth motion like presets. An optional camera control feature is available for certain cameras and the RM-1 as a connector output on the yoke to provide input/output signals. The PT-RM-1 is typically controlled by a Telemetrics Control Panel (CP-D-3A, RCP, or RCCP-1). Second party RS-232/422 control systems can also be used to interface with the unit. Please consult factory for configuration assistance.

This summary briefly describes the protocol for serial control of these devices. In the summary, the Telemetrics controlled device will be referred to as the “controller” and the device commanding the controller will be referred to as the “host”. Control is accomplished by sending commands consisting of ASCII characters terminated by an ASCII carriage return (<CR>, hex 0D). In most cases, several commands may be sent together on the same line before sending the <CR>. However, in the case of the recall preset command, other commands may precede it but any control commands following it on the same line are ignored. Feedback commands will still continue to respond. A control command line will not be executed until the <CR> is received. ASCII backspace (<BS>, hex 08) can be used to correct errors in the command line. After the command line has been executed, a <CR> will be sent back to the host to acknowledge completion. Communication rate is 9600 BAUD. Protocol is 8 data bits, one stop bit, and no parity. Each command consists of letters and may be followed by numerical parameters needed for the command. (Note: The commands are CASE SENSITIVE.) Numerical parameters are specified by the string of ASCII digits representing the decimal value. For example, a value of 26 is sent as a ‘2’ followed by a ‘6’, (i.e., hex 32, hex 36). Where a command has more than one parameter, the parameters should be separated by a space. No other spaces are necessary, though they may be used if desired. Important Note: In cases where the host does not monitor responding carriage returns from the controller, the host will not know whether a command line has been completed. The controller can receive new commands while it is processing previous commands except when the controller is processing a preset position recall. During a preset recall, all incoming characters are ignored except for an ASCII cancel character (<CAN>, control-X, hex 18) which tells the controller to abort the recall. Therefore, the host should send a <CAN> preceding all command lines. This way, if a recall was in progress, it will be aborted and the controller will accept the command. If no recall was in progress, the <CAN> will be ignored. The remainder of this summary describes the general methods for serial camera control. Commands will be introduced as they are needed. Note that while examples are shown enclosed in single quotes, only the characters within the quotes are to be sent; the quotes are simply for clarity. In addition, the examples may use unnecessary spaces for clarity, which need not be used for the actual application. Manual Camera Motion The procedure for manually moving a camera is as follows: 33 Reset motion voltages with the ‘R’ command. Move the camera using ‘P’, ‘T’ “Z’ and ‘F’ commands. The following 2 sections discuss the commands used. Camera Control Voltages Camera motion is controlled by four voltages corresponding to the velocity of pan, tilt, zoom and focus which are set using the ‘P’, ‘T’ ‘Z’ and ‘F; commands respectively. (An ‘X’ and ‘Y’ commands are also available to control the trolley and dolley, if used.) Iris control may be available depending on the control panel options and lenses. The commands have a single numerical parameter determining the voltage to which the output is set. The value of the parameter is in the range of 0 to 32767. A parameter value of 16383 is the point at which no motion occurs. As the value moves away from 16383, the speed of motion increases, and the direction of motion is determined by whether the value is greater or less than 16383 as follows: Command < Less than 16383 > Greater than 16383 ‘P’ Pan Right Left ‘T’ Tilt Down Up ‘Z’ Zoom In (Tele) Out (Wide) ‘F’ Focus ** Near Far ‘X’ Televator/Trolley Down/Right Up/Left ‘Y’ Dolley Right Left “I” Iris ** Close Open In addition, the ‘R’ command, which has no parameters, will reset all control voltages to the no motion value. There are many methods for determining control voltages. For instance, a joystick can be used and the value it outputs converted to the range 0 to 32767 for control voltages. Another example is with buttons. Each function has two buttons, one for each direction of motion (i.e. pan left and pan right). When a button is pressed, the camera is enabled. Initially the control voltage for the function is set for slow movement. Then the longer the button is held down, the faster the camera moves. If there is limited processing ability, button control can be done with simple on/off type control where pressing a button moves the corresponding function at a fixed speed. ** NOT AVAILABLE ON THE PT-RM-1 Preset Position Control 34 There are 64 preset positions, numbered 0 to 63, available in the controller’s non- volatile memory. The information stored in a preset location does not include the camera to which the preset corresponds. Therefore, it is up to the host application to select the proper camera to be used prior to preset operations The normal method for preset control is as follows: Read and store preset position with the ‘E’ command. Recall position using the ‘C’ command. The host can also store presets in its own memory by reading the position of the camera and using a variant of the recall command to recall the position: Read position using commands. Store data reported by controller. Recall position using ‘CX’ command with stored data. There are two additional commands related to presets. The ‘e’ command, whose parameter is a preset number, which reports to the host the position data stored in that preset number, in pan, tilt, zoom, focus order. The ‘EX’ command is a variant of the enter command. It stores external data in the controller’s preset storage. Its first parameter is the preset number in which to store the data, followed by the position data to be stored. The detailed descriptions of preset related commands follow in the next three sections. Preset Storing Commands The ‘E’ command stores the position of the currently selected camera. Its single parameter is the preset number into which to store the position For example, to store the current position into preset number 15: ‘E 15 <CR>‘ The ‘EX’ variant of the enter preset command allows host supplied data to be stored into a preset. The first parameter of this command is the preset number into which to store the data. This parameter is followed by position data corresponding to be stored into the preset. These data range varies from parameter to parameter. Here’s an example of this command: ‘EX 5 123 456 789 123 456 789 123 456 <CR>‘ Stores a pan position of 123, tilt position of 456, zoom position of 789 , focus position of 123, trolley position of 456, iris position of 789, master pedestal position of 123 and dolley position of 456 into preset number 5. 35 Preset Recalling Commands The ‘C’ command recalls the preset position stored in the preset number given as its parameter. As noted earlier in this document, once the controller begins a recall command, any control commands remaining on the command line are ignored. While the recall is in progress, the only character that will be acted upon is the <CAN> character to abort the shot. If the controller receives a <CAN> while in the midst of a recall, the camera will stop where it is and processing will continue as though the camera had actually reached the shot. After the recall is complete, the controller responds with a <CR>. For example to recall the position stored in preset number 41: ‘C 41 <CR>‘ The ‘CX’ variant of the recall command allows position data to be supplied directly by the host. ‘CX 123 456 789 123 456 789 123 456 789 <CR>‘ Preset Position Data Reporting The ‘e’ command, whose parameter is a preset number, sends back to the host the four position data stored in that preset number, in pan, tilt, zoom, focus order. These data are in the range for position data described earlier. For example, after externally entering the data in the example in the Preset Storing Commands section: Host sends: ‘e 5 <CR>‘ Controller responds: ‘123 456 789 123 456 789 123 456 <CR>‘ The ‘p’, ‘t’, ‘z’ and ‘f’ commands, having no parameters, read the current position of the pan, tilt, zoom and focus. For example,: Host sends: ‘p t z f <CR>‘ Controller responds: ‘111 222 333 444 <CR>‘ 36 Command Summary Request Commands COMMAND RETURN PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION p ± 2147483647 (± 2 31) Current Pan Position t ± 2147483647 (± 2 31) Current Tilt Position z 0 – 1024 (2 10) Current Zoom Position f 0 – 1024 (2 10) Current Focus Position x ± 2147483647 (± 2 31) Current Trolley/Pedestal Position y ± 2147483647 (± 2 31) Current Aux Position IM “IA” = AUTO “ILP” = LOCAL Return Iris Mode Velocity Commands COMMAND PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION P 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set Pan Velocity ( 0 = R ; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = L) T 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set Tilt Velocity ( 0 = D ; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = U) Z 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set Zoom Velocity ( 0 = T ; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = W) F ** 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set Focus Velocity ( 0 = N ; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = F) X 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set (Aux) Trk/Ped Velocity ( 0 = R,D; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = L,U) Y 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set Aux Velocity ( 0 = R ; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = L) I 0 – 32767 (2 15) Set Iris Velocity ( 0 = C ; 16383 = STOP ; 32767 = O) R <NONE> Stop All Motion ** NOT AVAILABLE ON THE PT-RM-1 37 Misc Commands COMMAND PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION B <NONE> Turn Tally On b <NONE> Turn Tally Off IA <NONE> Sets Iris to Auto Mode (Camera takes control) IL <NONE> Sets Iris to Local Mode (P/T takes control) BI ± 255 Increments Current Master Pedestal (Black) Position Preset Commands COMMAND PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION C 0 – 15 Call Preset Shot E 0 – 15 Enter Preset Shot e 0 – 15 Show Position Paramters for Shot 0x18 <NONE> Cancel Current Shot (press CTRL+X or send a hexadecimal 18) CX SPECIAL Call Preset Shot using supplied parameters EX SPECIAL Store Preset Shot using supplied parameters CX <Ppos> <Tpos> <Zpos> <Fpos> <Xpos> < Iris=pos> <PEDpos> < Ypos> <FADE> 38 Misc Setup Commands COMMAND PARAMETERS DESCRIPTION @ZERO 1010 Calibrate Lens @CNTR 1010 Perform Internal Home Position for p, t @CNTR 2020 Reset current position of all servo to zero @CNTR 2020 Reset Pan Tilt Servos 39 40 41 Repair Request RA# Please fill in completely.
