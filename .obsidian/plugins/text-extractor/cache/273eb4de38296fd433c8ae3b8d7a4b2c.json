Do not touch them under energized conditions, otherwise you may receive an electric shock. When you work with the top panel removed, caution is demanded. (2) No hot swap (MKS-8010B/CCP-6324/6224) When you connect and disconnect the 50PIN cable and module, be sure to do that after powering off MKS-8010B. The ICs on CA-76 board and KY boards may become defective. (3) Recommendation of shutdown (MKS-8010B) When power off MKS-8010B, you should turn the power off after shutdown. Otherwise, hard disk or CA-76 may become defective. 6 MKS-8010B Troubleshooting No startup after turning the power on Is the POWER indicator lit in green? Is the connection right? Do SW/LED of MAIN PANE light? Is MENU screen of MENU PANEL displayed? Please replace the power supply because the power supply is probably defective. No Yes Please see a connection diagram and connect correctly. No Yes Please install COMPACT FLASH. No Yes Is COMPACT FLASH Installed correctly? No For the 7SEG LED display on the near side of CA-76 board, check the A0, the LED rotation, the status of LED rotation from the left Yes Main, COM0, COM1 from the left are displayed. Check those 7SEG status. No No Yes Replace COMPACT FLASH. 7 CA-76 JTAG CHAIN Please use the following writing E filel. E-File No. E_000_004_60_01 JTAG CHAIN of MKS-8010B CA-76 is as follows (all BGA): CN2500 (A side E-2) EPR CN IC701 (A side E-3) EPM570 IC1000 (A side G-2) FPGA#1 IC1800 (Aside G-4) FPGA#2 Programming device function PLD (IC701) ADDRESS DECODER FPGA#1 (IC1000) NIOS KOA×2(COM0,COM1) FPGA#2 (IC1800) SBUS,SIO,PANEL I/F(SW,LED,LCD),LTC,FAN CTRL 8 Writing Data into Programming Devices For Writing Data into Programming Devices, please see “Writing/Rewriting the PLD Data” in the maintenance manual. ★Flash on CA-76 board IC900 IC901(AB side F-3): Application Software, Second Boot IC2502(B side F-3): FPGA#1 Configuration Data , NIOS Application Software Control LAN Mac Address , Peripheral LAN Mac Address ★EEPROM on CA-76 board IC602(B side F-4): SET Serial No. / Lot No. / Hard Version No. IC401(A side E-5): Internal LAN Mac Address IC6002(B side C-2): Internal LAN Mac Address IC7901(A side D-3): Data LAN Mac Address ★EEPROM on CN-3138 board IC1(A side D-2): SET Serial No. / Lot No. FLASH and EEPROM holding DATA 9 Remedy when second boot is corrupted (1/3) ★Preparation Prepare the following: CPU-DT Tool (see P-12.) Terminal Software, PC with Tera Term etc. RS-232C cable （3 pin – 9 pin) P/N:J-6402-640-A ★Procedure (1) Remove CPU-DT board (product) on CA-76 board and replace CPU-DT Tool. (2) Run the terminal software of PC and set Baud Rate to 9600. (3) Connect a RS-232C cable to CN601 on the front of CA-76 board. (4) Turn the power on.
