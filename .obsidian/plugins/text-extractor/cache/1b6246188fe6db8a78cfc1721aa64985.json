The 3080IPX128–25G makes the Evertz SDVN solution possible through its simple, reliable and deterministic routing of high bandwidth broadcast video, audio and data signals. The 3080IPX128–25G switch fabric has been developed purpose built for high capacity, low latency data routing with deterministic control essential for routing high resolution video and audio. Unlike other \"off the shelf\" network appliances which require extensive IT knowledge and programming experience, the IPX is a plug–and–play 25GbE switch fabric, customized to work seamlessly within a broadcast environment for the purpose of routing high bandwidth video and audio data. 3080IPX128–25G is based on an integrated multicast label switching architecture that unlocks the advantage of 25GbE without sacriﬁ cing ﬂ exibility and ease of control necessary for broadcast video and audio routing over LAN and WAN topologies. Fully integrated with Evertz' MAGNUM AV controller, the IPX is controlled using the same control methods of traditional baseband routers. Traditional control surfaces such as graphical user interfaces and hard button panels all can be used to control the 3080IPX128–25G network infrastructure. The 3080IPX128-25G series offers true wire rate of up to 25GbE ports, with zero contention at maximum bandwidth. The IPX128 employs QSFP+ technology and therefore can support either 1GbE/10GbE/25GbE single mode or multimode ﬁ ber at each port. A single QSFP can also be conﬁ gured to support 40GbE and 100GbE on up to 32x QSFP modules. The IPX128 is a hot–swappable device, which allows for the hardware to be replaced without having to re–cable, saving hours of downtime. The 3080IPX128–25G provides reliable security and eliminates the worry of network loops and intruders on the network through its highly conﬁ gurable ports. Each port on the IPX is controlled via MAGNUM, and therefore only authorized devices and trafﬁ c are permitted on the network. The IPX can be monitored using SNMP using Evertz’ VistaLINK Pro NMS software.
