Video Trap Control Company Confidential ▪ The Audio Notify page allows the user to monitor audio pair failures for all pairs on each SDI. ▪ When an audio pair is lost the Audio Fault will be triggered. Audio Trap Controls Company Confidential ▪ The System Notify page allows the user to configure which traps will be monitored for the different components of the 570IPG modules. Including: • Reference Loss • SFP Presence/Bandwidth Limit • Encapsulator Faults • Decapsulator Faults System Notify Controls Company Confidential ▪ When setting the SNMP trap on the 570IPG use the main frame controller page ▪ Enter the IP of each VM, not the Cluster IP. ▪ Select Apply when the address has been entered. SNMP Trap Controls Company Confidential ▪ The following is a list of required parameters that get set on the 570IPG: • Route Table: this will determine where the SDI In/Out is feed to/from (pushed by Magnum-SDVN) • SDI Input Parameters: these should match with the type of signal being transmitted (i.e. EvertzTS/SMPTE2022-6/ASPEN) • SDI Output Parameters: these should match the signal being received ▪ The following parameters can be checked on the 570IPG: • The bandwidth of a port (both transmit and receive) • The SFP Power levels • The SFP Temperature • SDI Input Presence/SDI Output Presence • IP Input Presence/IP Output Presence Parameters which are Set on the 570IPG","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
