VLC will restart with a fully populated channel list. (continued on next page) In the playlist window right click in the empty space in the “Title” bar area. Make sure “Artist” and “ID” are checked and everything else is unchecked. *Important Note* The “Title” field should automatically be present by default. The “Artist” field displays the channel numbers. The “Title” field displays the channel names. The “ID” field is used only in case either of the other 2 fields are accidentally sorted causing the channel list to be out of order. If that happens, click on “ID” to sort by the “ID” field and it will restore proper channel order. (continued on next page) Ending Note: If all of the steps have been followed correctly, every time VLC is opened it will automatically tune to stream IPTV with the channel list open next to the video window. If something doesn’t appear correctly or if there is no streaming after re-checking these steps, contact 2nd Fl. Engineering at 212-664-7724.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
