Adapt- able and scalable to meet current and changing needs, the GTP also provides comprehensive diagnostic, logging, and troubleshooting tools to identify and resolve control problems quickly. Powerful, Flexible GPI Routing With the GTP-32, it’s easy to route GPIs and tallies among equipment, control rooms, studios, venues, and stages. The options are endless. Route one GPI input to one GPO output or to multiple GPO outputs. Route a local GPI to a remote destination on another floor, in another building, or at another facility. Route a remote GPI to a local destina- tion. Create, save, and restore GPI routing maps for fast system reconfiguration. Designed specifically for broadcast and production environments, the GTP-32 control processor is the foundation of your facility’s control infrastructure, offering simple, cost-effective, and easily accessible solutions to complex and conditional control problems. With powerful GPI and tally routing, depend- able serial and Ethernet monitoring, control, and interfacing solutions, the GTP-32 control processor is unlike anything on the market. It combines an easy-to-use interface with extensive support of broadcast and produc- tion equipment to deliver both centralized and distributed control over machinery and workflows — in the same room, between buildings, across campus, and around the globe. GTP-32 Control Processor Control Infrastructure Solutions Made Simple and Accessible Part of DNF’s Flex Control Network®, the GTP-32 control processor is the founda- tion of your facility’s control infrastructure. With the GTP-32, you get: • Powerful GPI and tally routing • Dependable serial and Ethernet monitoring, control, and interfacing • Simple setup and configuration (or reconfiguration) using a standard Web browser with no programming or scripting • Comprehensive diagnostic, logging, and troubleshooting tools • Ability to automate repetitive events and create rule-based, conditional system behavior • . . . and more Flex Control Network The GTP-32 is part of DNF’s Flex Control Network®, a modular platform of profes- sional IP-based controllers. Flex gives you fast, simple, reliable, repeatable control that fits your workflow, infrastructure, and facility. Designed for enhanced scalability, Flex affords high-speed, real-time control. Its distributed control architecture puts processing power where it is needed, elimi- nates the single point of failure of a central controller, and provides built-in redundancy. Simple to set up, configure, and reconfigure using a standard Web browser, the GTP-32 requires no programming or scripting. Simply use your Web browser to select from a drop-down menu and fill in a text box. The GTP-32 replaces impossible-to-support custom solutions, extends the life of existing equipment, and integrates dissimi- The Business of Flex Flex Control Network provides a complete control and connectivity infrastructure that: • Integrates with existing equipment, protecting equipment investments • Incorporates new equipment and technological advances • Maintains existing workflows and integrates new workflows for time-accurate content delivery • Improves system reliability, supports expansion, and simplifies mainte- nance • Fits your application and budget • Gives you peace of mind Infinite possibilities for centralized and distributed control Leveraging 20+ Years of Must- Work Control Solutions DNF has more than 20 years of experi- ence providing “must work,” mission- critical control systems for broadcast and production operations. DNF Controls’ core competencies: • Extensive knowledge, understanding, and use of equipment control protocols for television broadcast, television production, live and sports production, industrial video, military, and professional corporate uses • Extensive knowledge and understand- ing of human interaction with equip- ment and technology to provide fast, easy, reliable, and repeatable control and workflow • Providing control integration solutions ― technology, hardware, and software ― that enable a wide range of equip- ment from different manufacturers with dissimilar control protocols to co-exist successfully in an integrated system under human and machine control control | monitoring | inter facing V: 818.898.3380 F: 818.898.3360 sales@dnfcontrols.com www.dnfcontrols.com An Alternative to Running Multiconduc- tor Cables Because it runs on Flex Control Network’s Ethernet-based architecture, the GTP-32 eliminates problems with full cable troughs, intermittent GPI and tally signals due to long runs and multiple connections, and RS232/RS422 connections. Also gone are steering diodes and isolation problems when interconnecting control rooms, production trucks, and dissimilar devices. Using GTP-32, broadcasters can signifi- cantly reduce the time and manpower required to set up, test, and troubleshoot GPI and tally wiring, and serial and Ethernet interfaces. Complex and Conditional Control Made Easy The GTP-32 lets you easily create simple or complex rules to define specific output behaviors based upon a single input or multiple inputs — key press, timer timeout, device status, tally, etc. Use conditional control to create “what if” scenarios when a simple key press or GPI is not enough. Easily define modes of operation based upon the state of a specific input or inputs. Networked Control As part of the Flex Control Network product line, the GTP-32 can control, monitor, and interface with a wide range of devices over GPI/O, RS232, RS422, Ethernet, UDP, TCP/IP, SNMP, and more using industry- standard and proprietary control protocols. You can connect devices and control points over LAN, WAN, VPN, and Internet – within the same room, between floors, across campus buildings, among OB trucks, or more – making it possible to link geographi- cally separated facilities and connect coun- tries. The GTP-32 makes it easy to share GPIs, device status or tallies, GPOs, and device control between devices and across control points. Comprehensive Diagnostic and Troubleshooting Tools The GTP-32’s built-in diagnostics and logging features help you quickly identify and resolve problems. Extensive logging records all inputs and the resulting actions — with date and timestamp — in seven one-day logs. And you have quick and easy access to diagnostic data via log files using a Web browser to aid in reviewing system operation and resolving issues. Designed For Non-Programmers The GTP-32 is designed with non-program- mers in mind, so it’s simple to set up, configure, and reconfigure using a standard Web browser. The interface relies on simple drop-down menus and text boxes, with no programming or scripting required. Robust Connectivity and Control Because Flex Control Network uses an embedded, non-Windows® operating system, the GTP-32 won’t compromise your network. Whether it resides on a sensitive corporate LAN or a dedicated network, or users access it through VPN, Flex provides reliable connec- tivity and accurate control throughout your facility — and around the world. Create centralized systems in an equipment or control room, or distributed systems with equipment located for opti- mum efficiency.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
