These backups should be retrieved and archived in a suitable location. Any SCP client can be used to accomplish this, the WinSCP windows client is used in the following example. Perform the actions below on all three homeservers Prior to downloading a backup, you must set the correct ownership of the backup (By default, they are owned by root). SSH into the HOME server and change to the /opt/home-release/backups directory: cd /opt/home-release lawo@homeserver1:~$ cd /opt/home-release/   lawo@homeserver1:/opt/home-release/backups$3 ls -l drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Sep  5 13:15 05-09-22-131524 Use the following command to set the correct file ownership to all backups: sudo chown -R lawo:lawo backups/* lawo@homeserver1:/opt/home-release$ 4 sudo chown -R lawo:lawo backups/* [sudo] password for lawo: lawo@homeserver1:/opt/home-release$ 5 ls -l backups/ drwxr-xr-x 3 lawo lawo 4096 Sep  5 13:15 05-09-22-131524 The SSH session can now be disconnected exit lawo@homeserver1:/opt/home-release/backups$6 exit logout Connection to 192.168.60.81 closed. Open WinSCP and start a session. The password may have been changed, consult project documentation and the client if necessary.
