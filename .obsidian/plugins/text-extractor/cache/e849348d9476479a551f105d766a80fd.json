CA-54CFA Board The CA-54CFA board performs the following signal processing.· Clock signal and timing signal that are synchronized with the reference signal are generated and sent to the respective circuit boards.· Control LAN and the Data LAN communication· RS-422 communication· GPI input/output· Application software control and data management· Control over the entire systemThe CA-54CFA board consists of the following circuit boards.· CA-54CFA board itself· SG-272 board· DIF-130 board· SIO-25EF board· Main CPU module· CPU module for Control LAN· CPU module for Data LANThe CA-54CFA board itself accepts the above-described child boards and modules on it, and outputs the various information (such as FAN ERR signal, power information, reference signal information and communication-related information) to outside as the indicator displays or the output data. The CA-54CFA board supports the Ethernet and the RS-422 communications. Various settings such as ID (IP address and others) are set using the DIP switches on the CA-54CFA board. The power supply voltages of 12 V and 3.3 V are supplied to each block. The SG-272 board is installed on the CA-54CFA board, and generates the horizontal sync pulse (HD), vertical sync pulse (VD), field information (FD), register load pulse (CKX), clock signal (HCLK) and analog reference signals that are synchronized with the external reference signals. PLD (IC113) that controls the SG-272 board, is automatically programmed by the PROM (IC302) when the power is turned on. The PLD is controlled by the main CPU that rewrites the PLD register through the local bus so that the reference signal phase and the output signal phase can be changed. The SG-272 board supports both HD (1080i system) and SD (525/625) signal formats.Status of the reference signal can be checked through the LEDs on the SG-272 board and the indicator on the CA-54CFA board. The SG-272 board receives the 12 V power from the CA-54CFA board and generates the 5 V, 3.3 V, and 1.8 V powers.The DIF-130 board is installed on the CA-54CFA board. The DIF-130 board has the function of interfacing and controlling the compact flash card that is installed in the DIF-130 board. The compact flash card that is installed in this board contains the MVE system program and the configuration data for the FPGAs installed on each circuit board. The DIF-130 board is controlled by the COM CPU_2 on the CA-54CFA board through the PCI bus. Interface and control between the PCI bus and the compact flash card are performed by the controller (IC1) on the DIF-130 board. The DIF-130 board has the two sockets for compact flash card: socket A and socket B. The socket A contains the compact flash card in which all of the data that are required to start up the MVE system are saved. The socket B is the spare socket used for data copying and others. The 3.3 V power is supplied from the CA-54CFA board. The SIO-25EF board is installed on the CA-54CFA board, and performs the RS-422 data communication using the four-channel SIO controller (IC102,111,118,126). The SIO performs the data exchange with the main CPU through the dual port RAM (IC101,110,117,125) to convert between parallel and serial data.The CA-54CFA board contains the three CPU modules. The first CPU module is the main CPU module that controls the entire system and controls GPI input and output. The other two modules are the CPU modules for communication that are in charge of the Control LAN and the Data LAN respectively. For the RS-422 communications, the CPU modules for communication are in charge of two ports each.The entire system is controlled through the local CPUs and the dual port memories that are installed in the each board (the DVP-24A board, the VIF-28 board and others).","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
