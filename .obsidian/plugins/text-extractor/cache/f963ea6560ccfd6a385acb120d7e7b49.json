RC-90 Board (MKS-8701) The RC-90 board contains the 54 channels of the Tally Output and the GPI Output circuits. Each channel is used either as Tally or GPI. The information whether each channel is used as Tally or GPI is memorized in the Center Control Panel side to which the MKS-8700 Device Control Unit (DCU) is connected. The RC-90 board can be installed in any desired slot of slot 2 to slot 6 of the MKS-8700 main unit. The Tally Output data and the GPI Output data are written in the PIO of the RC-90 board from the main CPU of the CA-47 board installed in slot 1. The Tally Output data and GPI Output data turn on and off the relays and feed the output connectors CN501 to CN503 via the MB-949 board and the CN-2195 board on the rear slot. The power supply voltages of 3.3 V and +5 V within the RC-90 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-949 board. The relays are directly driven by +12 V.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
