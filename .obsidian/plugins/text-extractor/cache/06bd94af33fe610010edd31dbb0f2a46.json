Connect the BP-32 power supply to POWER connector. 2. Connect the second BP-32 power supply to second POWER connector for redundancy. BP-32 CONFIGURATION PHOENIX TWO PIN CONNECTORS. Each GPI and each GPO has its own 2 pin connector. The GPOs reside on the top row of the BP-32 and the GPIs reside on the bottom row of the BP-32. Each GPI and GPO may be configured for Wet or Dry mode using jumpers below the phoenix connector. When using the GPI WET mode, a short across the two GPI pins is required to activate the GPI’s. SET GPI WET/DRY MODE Configure Wet/Dry mode for each individual GPI using the jumpers located below the GPI connector. To set to DRY mode, use only one jumper across the two center pins (D). To set to WET mode, use two jumpers across the two outside pins (WW). SET GPO WET/DRY MODE Configure Wet/Dry mode for each individual GPO using the jumpers below the GPO connector. The DRY mode uses only one jumper across the two center pins (D). The wet mode uses two jumpers across the two outside pins (WW). GPI/GPO CONNECTOR PINOUT DRY MODE = EXTERNAL POWER WET MODE = BP-32 PROVIDES POWER GPI CONNECTOR Dry Mode: Pin #1: Cathode ( - ) Pin #2: Anode ( + ) Wet Mode: Pin #1: Cathode ( - ) Pin #2: Ground GPO CONNECTOR Dry Mode: Pin #1: N.O. Pin #2: Relay Common Wet Mode: Pin #1: N.O. Pin #2: Ground BP-32 Manual WWW.TSLPRODUCTS.COM Page 6 of 10 “PWR SEL” JUMPER for GPO’s The BP-32 contains a “PWR SEL” jumper located in the center of the mainboard. The purpose of this jumper is to select the power source that will feed all of the GPO’s. Jumpers placed across PINS 1 and 2 will put the BP-32 GPO’s into “INTERNAL +5V” mode. When in “INTERNAL +5V” mode the GPO’s will draw power from the 5V power supplies attached to the rear POWER connectors. Jumpers placed across PINS 2 and 3 will put the BP-32 GPO’s into “GPO_COMBUS” mode. This is the default mode. When in “GPO_COMBUS” mode the GPO’s will draw power from the common bus via external power. “EXTERNAL POWER” CONNECTOR An external power connector labeled “EXT. POWER” is located on the right side of the mainboard. Connecting an external power supply to the “EXT. POWER” connector allows GPO’s to support voltages higher than 5V and up to a maximum of 28V. If GROUND is needed on the common bus instead of voltage, short the pins on the “EXT. POWER” connector. BP-32 Manual WWW.TSLPRODUCTS.COM Page 7 of 10 GTP-32 CONFIGURATION The breakout panel has two sets of 37 pin connectors, one set is labeled “GPI” and the other set is labeled “GPO”. Connect the furnished 37 pin interconnect cable to the matching connector on the breakout panel and the GTP-32 unit. Connect all 4 cables to their respective connectors. Example: Legend on GTP-32 unit = GPI 1-16; connect to GPI 1-16 connector on breakout panel. Legend on GTP-32 unit = GPI 17-32; connect to GPI 17-32 connector on breakout panel Legend on GTP-32 unit = GPO 1-16; connect to GPO 1-16 connector on breakout panel. Legend on GTP-32 unit = GPO 17-32; connect to GPO 17-32 connector on breakout panel USP3-8/AIB-2 CONFIGURATION When connecting a USP3-8 or AIB-2 to a BP-32 breakout panel the connections are as follows: GPI CONNECTION 1. Using a DB25 cable, connect one end of the cable into the GPI 1-8 port of the USP/AIB. 2. Connect the other side of the DB25 cable into the DB25 GPI 1-8 connector on the BP-32 breakout panel. GPO CONNECTION 1. Using a DB25 cable, connect one end of the cable into the GPO 1-8 port of the USP/AIB. 2. Connect the other side of the DB25 cable into the DB37 GPO 1-8 connector on the BP-32 breakout panel. USP3-16/AIB-3/AIB-4 CONFIGURATION When connecting a USP3-16, AIB-2 or AIB-4 to a BP-32 breakout panel the connections are as follows: GPI CONNECTION 1. Using a DB25 cable, connect one end of the cable into the GPI 1-8 port of the USP/AIB. 2. Connect the other side of the DB25 cable into the DB25 GPI 1-8 connector on the BP-32 breakout panel. 3. Using a second DB25 cable, connect one end of the cable into the GPI 9-16 port of the USP/AIB. 4. Connect the other side of the DB25 cable into the DB25 GPI 9-16 connector on the BP-32 breakout panel. GPO CONNECTION 1.
