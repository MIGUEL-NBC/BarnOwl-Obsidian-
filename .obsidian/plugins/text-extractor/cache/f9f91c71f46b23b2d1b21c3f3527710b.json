We’ve done this by creating contractor SSOs and then logging them into Microsoft Teams on utility corp PCs and VMs. These utility PCs and VMs have video inputs, so in Microsoft Teams we have set up “Meetings” where the PC is the presenter and the video input acts as the webcam/microphone. This allows anyone with an SSO to join the meeting and see the video and hear the audio from the SDI source going into the PCs. The latency is very small (less than 1 second) and the quality is great. This has become the go-to resource for producers looking at the main 31/32/1A/71 monitor walls. Occasionally, someone will complain the audio was muted on these streams. That happens when someone in the meeting accidentally hits “Mute Participant”. To fix this, you would need to VNC into the PC hosting the meeting and unmute the microphone. 1. Identify exactly which Multiview folks are having issues with (i.e. 31 main wall, network main wall, etc). 2. Go to the WFH Streaming Info doc and go to the tab labeled Microsoft Teams Multiviews. 3. Find the line corresponding to the Multiview that needs to have the audio fixed 4. VNC to the IP associated with that PC 5. If Microsoft Teams is minimized, click on it to open it up. 6. Hover over the meeting window and you should see a camera and a microphone in the main bar; the microphone will have a slash thru it indicated that it is muted. 7. Click on the microphone to unmute the audio 8. Fixed The second scenario is that video and audio have disappeared or stopped working. This is because there may be an error with the meeting where the organizer has lost the session. 1. Repeat steps 1 thru 5 from above to get into the Meeting as the organizer 2. You will likely see that there is an option to Retry to rejoin the meeting. Click on Retry and you should be back in the meeting with the correct video and audio. 3. You may need to VNC to the second PC associated with this meeting and follow this same process. We keep two PCs linked to each meeting because otherwise they would time out after 30 minutes of no one being in the meeting.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
