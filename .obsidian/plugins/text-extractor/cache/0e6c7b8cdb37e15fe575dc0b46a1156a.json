This document is Cisco Public Information. Page 1 of 11 Data Sheet Cisco Nexus 9300 PoE Fixed Switch, N9K- C9348GC-FXP-B1 Product overview Based on Cisco Cloud Scale technology, the Cisco Nexus® N9K-C9348GC-FXP-B1 is the first Pow er over Ethernet (PoE) fixed sw itch in the next generation Nexus 9300 Series Sw itches. Carrying on the success of the Nexus 9300- EX series, the Cisco Nexus 9300-FX series based PoE sw itch is built on modern system architecture designed to provide high performance, support cost effective deployments, and meet the evolving needs of entry-level enterprises, midmarket, and small branch office netw orks. The Cisco Nexus® N9K-C9348GC- FXP-B1 sw itch allow s connectivity to Ethernet pow ered devices including Cisco IP phones, w ireless access points, and video cameras. The product supports pre-standard PoE devices and is IEEE 802.3af and IEEE 802.3at-compliant. With PoE, the need to have w all pow er to each PoE enabled device is no longer required and as such, the cost for additional electrical cables and circuits is no longer necessary in IP phone and WLAN deployments. Pow er injectors and PoE mid-spans are also no longer required. With optimized efficiency, simplified operation and installation, and a w ide array of device versatility, the Cisco Nexus ® N9K- C9348GC-FXP-B1 provides investment protection for customers in an ever-changing data centric and grow ing connected market. The expansive feature set includes 40MB of intelligent buffering, support for Voice VLANs, a full feature L2/L3 ASIC, and dual 1100W pow er supplies that provide up to 2000W of PoE pow er. Sw itch model Table 1 summarizes the Cisco Nexus® N9K-C9348GC-FXP- B1 PoE Sw itch Table 1.
