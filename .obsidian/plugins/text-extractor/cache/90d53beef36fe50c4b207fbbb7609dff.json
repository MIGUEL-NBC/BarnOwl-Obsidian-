The paradigm shift from discrete, fixed function hardware to compute pools of generic hardware with licensable software services provides a flexible, scalable, agile broadcast infrastructure to dynamically meet and adapt to changing facility requirements. evEDGE virtualized broadcast infrastructure provides the necessary toolsets to easily manage, license, deploy, and operate core video/audio/ancillary services as needed across the evEDGE supported compute platforms. The evBLADE-5Z10-HW is a multi-node FPGA accelerated compute blade for the evEDGE virtualized broadcast infrastructure platform. The evBLADE offers high density FPGA processing nodes that are dynamically reconfigurable to provide customized audio, video and ancillary data processing pipelines. The evBLADE provides agility and flexibility of a virtualized environment while also ensuring low latency, low power, deterministic and reliable FPGA processing pipelines. Using software orchestration, the evBLADE can be easily reconfigured to support different processing pipelines, allowing for greater efficiency and utilization of compute with respect to fixed function devices or COTS hardware. The evBLADE allows you to accomplish precisely what you need, when you need it. The evBLADE contains four compute nodes that provide unmatched processing capacity. One example of a deployable pipeline on a single node is a 7814UDX- 2 dual path 3G/HD/SD Up/Down/Cross conversion with frame synchronization, color correction, noise reduction and logo insertion along with a rich feature set of audio processing and ancillary data processing. This provides the equivalent of 4x 7814UDX-2 modules on a single evBLADE — double the density of a fixed function 7814UDX-2 installation. The evBLADE supports a growing library of software licensable and deployable core video/audio/ancillary data processing services, making it a future proof platform to meet not only the needs of today, but also the needs of tomorrow. The evBLADE will support SMPTE 2110, UltraHD (4K), and High Dynamic Range (HDR) conversion. Microservices can be bundled into single services or grouped together in templates for easy deployment. Please contact Evertz for an up-to-date list of available services. evBLADE compute nodes are fully managed via a RESTful webAPI. Service control and configuration are also available over SNMP. These interfaces provide seamless integration with Evertz MAGNUM Unified Facility Control, VistaLINK PRO, Mediator, and third party systems. The evBLADE compute nodes also supports Evertz’ inSITE. This brings operational intelligence to the forefront with historical analysis of all operations over the compute pool including system health and utilization information. The evEDGE platform facilitates management, licensing, monitoring, and deployment of services across the multi-platform compute pool — including evBLADE, COTS servers, and private/public cloud instances. evBLADE-5Z10-HW evEDGE Virtualized FPGA Accelerated Compute Blade }System Block Diagram Front Panel Rear Panel evBLADE-5Z10-HW evEDGE Virtualized FPGA Accelerated Compute Blade }Licensed Services Video Service Description Frame Sync Maintains synchronization of output audio / video / ancillary data to reference Video Processor Full-featured video processing/colour correction engine with YCbCr and RGB colour space adjustments Up/Down/Cross ConversionSD/HD/3G standard conversion with high quality motion adaptive deinterlacing and fully configurable broadcast video scaler with AFD triggering *Color Legalizer Image processing engine that gracefully maintains legal RGB colour values *HDR/SDR Conversion HDR/SDR conversion engine to convert between HDR formats (HLG, Slog3, SMPTE 2084), and between HDR and SDR *Keyer Keyer engine for performing Key+Fill blending operations, and file based graphics insertion onto program content *Chroma Keyer Chroma Keyer engine for performing chroma blending operations of live fill or file based fill onto program content *Logo Inserter Keys static or dynamic logo/bug onto video signal *Video Delay Video delay adjustment at pixel, line, and frame granularity *Thumbnails Transmits lower resolution snapshots of the video signal over IP to a VistaLINK PRO Thumnail server for confidence monitoring Service Description Audio Delay Global and per channel (x16) audio delay adjustments with audio sample granularity *Audio Processor Audio processor with per channel (x16) X & Y mixing / gain / inversion IntelliGain 16-channel IntelliGain loudness audio processor Upmix Stereo to 5.1 surround audio upmixer with input signal driven auto upmixing Downmix 5.1 surround to stereo audio downmixer Audio Service Description Closed Captions Closed caption translation processor for CEA608 to CEA708 conversion OP42/27 WST Teletext translation processor with OP42 to/from OP47 conversion Time Code D-VITC, ANC-VITC, ANC-LTC Time code processor and inserter AFD Active Format Description (AFD) monitor & inserter *Name Dropper Name Dropper encoder for downstream keyer control Ancillary Service Description SDI to ASPEN + FS SDI audio / video / ancillary encapsulation to multi-essence ASPEN streams with FS *SDI to SMPTE 2110 + FS SDI audio / video / ancillary encapsulation to multi-essence SMPTE 2110 streams with FS Gateway * Consult with Evertz on availability of service.
