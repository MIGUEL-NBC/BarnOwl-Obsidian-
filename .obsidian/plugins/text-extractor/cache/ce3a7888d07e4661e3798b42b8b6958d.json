These routers are no longer needed since SatOps/TOC workflows were moved to the ACQ-EXE. During the shutdowns, we worked alongside MTC to make sure none of their services or workflows were impacted. We donâ€™t expect there to be any reason that we would need to power them back up, but please reach out if you get any odd related reports. Thanks!
