Plug in the USB on the front of the CCU. Hold Display Toggle down, Cancel toggle up, and push the knob (all within menu section) simultaneously. While holding, power CCU on. You can let go of keys when you see it booting to a grey updating screen. 4. CCU will update on its own. Keep an eye on the status as it will eventually complete and prompt you to power it off. Unplug the USB after you power off to prevent damage to the USB drive. Power CCU back on. 5. Once CCU boots back up, use the Display toggle to open the menu. Go to Diagnostics, page 3.

Click the white arrow at the end of the row to access the page. 2. Make sure you are on the correct CCU page, the CCU listed at the very top of the sheet indicates the active CCU.

If you encounter network issues where the web gui shows network disconnected, you should upgrade the CCUs manually to prevent firmware corruption.
