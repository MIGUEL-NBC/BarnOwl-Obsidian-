In the event that both engines have problems or fail, there is a salvo on the Miranda NV9616 panel at the TD station to go to 1A 1A BR which will switch in the Barco S3 4K Jr. scaler. This box is located in 1A ER Rack 5 along with all the other gear for the curved LED wall. The Barco inputs and outputs all come to patch and then normal to and from a Grass Valley CR6400 3G router. This router is what the salvo at the TD station is controlling. The Barco scaler has four inputs, all of which can be displayed on the wall. However, production has chosen to use the scaler as a single input display for now. That means that only input 1 (1A local router destination MON-1AS5) is visible. That one input is set to scale up to fit the entire wall; left, right and top are kept fully visible, and the bottom third is cropped. If there is a problem with the box, the simplest and quickest fix is to just restore the backup config file…this will interrupt video out of the box, so this must be done at an off time.

This software will not run on most laptops. Open the Event Master Toolset from the desktop and at the bottom left enter the IP address from the scaler: 3.199.20.20. Click Add System. Now click on the gear icon on the top left area: Select Tools: Select Backup and Restore: Drag the restore file to the Restore green Drag N Drop area. The restore file can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cnhaw3qe9994nc4/AABfO3GbGyyHBJ-vspeeOV2oa?dl=0 Proceed with any prompts asking if you’re sure you want to restore the system. The system will ask if you want to proceed with a restart, which is required to restore the configuration. Proceed. This restart will take approximately 2-3 minutes; during this time, the LED wall may go blue. When the system comes back up, you should be back in a normal configuration.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
