{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Studio Maintenance - Firmware Repository/RCP/Explanation email for F drop and Relative button.docx","text":"Hi Nick, The relative button is designed to come back on under the conditions attached (Relative Value.docx). Please check the F Drop Menu (attached F Drop Menu.docx) and compare it to another RCP that does not have any F Drop indication. It may just be not enough light coming into the camera at the time. The list of software versions looks like it is 2 different models of RCP. The version 1.11 RCPs are probably RCP-3500s and the other 2.12, 3.30, and 3.40 are probably RCP-1500s. I believe it would be best practice to update all of the RCP-1500s to version 3.80 and all of the RCP-3500s to version 1.30 while making sure the CCUs and Cameras are also up to the latest compatible versions. I do not think the software is causing a problem right now but it would be best to have everything up to date and running the same versions.

The Nightly News video op brought to our attention an issue he is having with an RCP in 3S Video. First thing we did was look at what version it is on, and we found it’s on an older version and the entire bank of RCP’s are on a few different firmware versions. The issue is that he turns the “Relative” button off and it will automatically turn itself back on, and second issue is the F drop error comes on. Here is a list of the RCP’s and which version they are on, obviously a lot of them are on the older version but he only really uses the last 3 RCP’s and noticed the issue with the last one. Any idea what could be causing this? Should we work on getting all of the RCP’s to be on the same firmware? RCP 49 – Ver1.11 RCP 50 – Ver1.11 RCP 51 – Ver1.11 RCP 52 – Ver1.11 RCP 53 – Ver1.11 RCP 54 – Ver2.12 RCP 55 – Ver1.11 RCP 56 – Ver1.11 RCP 57 – Ver3.30 RCP 58 – Ver3.40 RCP 59 – Ver3.40 RCP 60 – Ver1.11 Nick Caliendo NBC Universal Studio Engineering nick.caliendo@nbcuni.com 347-491-2981","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
