In fact we invented it! Now with the introduction of the iAM Series, Wohler has re-invented this critical piece of broadcast technology for the modern media enterprise. Flexible. Adaptable. Future Proof. Specifically designed for fast-paced OB, studio and live-to-air production environments, iAM-MIX provides intuitive audio signal monitoring with instant access to 8 stored configurations of any user-defined channel groups for easy navigation between up to 64 channels. iAM-MIX comes equipped with input options for Analog, AES3, 3G/HD/SD-SDI and multi/ singlemode fiber and coax MADI audio, alongside either Dante™ or Ravenna / AES67 and allows any source format to be routed to the front panel controls for monitoring and mixing. Choose from either 8 or 16 level controls both with an independent master level control and instant mute capability. Individual OLED display indicators show status, presence metering and channel name – which can be manually edited or automatically read from a network connected router. Multiple units on the same network can be controlled via a browser-based user interface that supports fast configuration with role-based authentication to protect critical setups. iAM-MIX is the perfect solution for any application that requires a simple, compact solution for monitoring a range of audio signals. Units are available with either 8 or 16 controls. Features/Benefits: • Fast selection and summing of up to 16 audio channels. • Intuitive front panel with 8 or 16 individual level controls and quick muting. • Channel names can be displayed for each input. • Store and retrieve presets via USB or remote software control. • Built-in speakers, headphone jack, USB and Ethernet ports. • A range of useful connectors, including SFP slots for future I/O support. • API for remote control. • Apply software feature upgrades with zero downtime. • Compact, space-saving units.
