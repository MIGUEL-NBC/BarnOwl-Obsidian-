XPT Block IC1401 is a cross-point IC. 160 x160 channels can be selected with one IC401. MVS-8000X XPT-31 Board 10 5/1/2012 Processes orders from the main CPU by the CPU module (CPU-DP) on the XPT-31 board and reads/writes data from/to each IC and the local buss control board. Ethernet transmission with the main CPU Outputs the signal to control each IC and the local buss control board by IC601 (Address Decoder). IC601 controls the cross-point IC. IC1001[FLASH] stores the application data of CPU. IC510[EEPROM] stores the board-specific ID and the serial no. IC511[THERMO] measures the board temperature. XPT-31 Board controls such boards as XPT-31A, XPT-32, OUT-35/35A, FC-112×2 by the CPU module (CPU-DP) on the XPT-31 board. * When the XPT-31 board is not installed or when the CPU block have a breakdown, such boards as XPT-31A, XPT-32, OUT-35/35A and FC-112 do not start up and operate. 2-3.
