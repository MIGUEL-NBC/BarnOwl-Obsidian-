This operation is valid only when BB is selected in the <Ref Input Format> group. In the MVS-7000X, format conversion is assigned to primary inputs in advance. For details about the primary input assignment, see “Selecting the Primary Input to be Used in the Format Converter” (page 204). Format converter Installing the Format Converter Board in the switcher enables the following signal video format conversions. • Up-conversion: from SD (4:3) to HD (16:9) • Down-conversion: from HD (16:9) to SD (4:3) • Cross-conversion: from HD (720P) to HD (1080i), or from HD (1080i) to HD (720P) In the MVS-8000X, the maximum number of input signals for which format conversion is possible is 16 (or 8 when only one MKS-8450X board is installed), and the maximum number of output signals is 4 (two outputs when the MKS-8160X is not installed). In the MVS-7000X, the maximum number of primary input signals for which format conversion is possible is 8, and the maximum number of output signals is 4 (two outputs when the MKS-8160X is not installed). • After format conversion, input and output signals have one-frame delays with respect to the reference signals. To synchronize converted input signals and unconverted input signals, it is possible to delay the unconverted input signal. For details, see “To delay unconverted input signals (frame delay function)” (page 144). • When the input reference signal for HD system is set to Tri Sync, the format converter function is not available. For details, see “Switching the Input Reference Signal for HD System” (page 142). Format combinations allowing conversion The supported combinations of switcher signal format and format converter (inputs 1 to 4, 5 to 8, 9 to 12 and 13 to 16) are as follows. (Inputs 9 to 12 and 13 to 16 are available only in the MVS- 8000X.) The format converter cannot be used when the signal format is 1080PsF/23.976 or 1080PsF/24. a) Only on MVS-8000X b) Output signals converted from 720P format are not synchronized to the switcher input reference signal.

Adding User Texture Patterns You can add user created texture patterns to the repertory of texture patterns with which the spotlighting function enables the light falls on the image surface. This function is not supported on the MVE-8000A and MKS-7470X/7471X. For details of spotlighting and texture patterns, see “Spotlighting Settings” in Chapter 11 (Volume 1). The procedure for adding a texture pattern is as follows. To prepare a texture file Create a texture file meeting the following conditions, and save it on a memory card. File format: Windows bmp (“bitmap”) (extension: bmp, 24-bit RGB) File name: alphanumeric (maximum 8 characters) + extension (bmp) Example: wood_01.bmp Image size (horizontal × vertical): 128 × 128 to 1024 × 1024 pixels The maximum number of texture files that can be handled by the system is related to the image size of the texture files, as shown in the following table (when all images are the same size). • Different image sizes can be combined, but this affects the total number of texture files that can be handled. • The number of texture files that can be handled may be reduced, depending on the way in which they are stored in memory. • For a texture file with an image size outside the specification, the minimum enclosing image size is applied (see table above), and the region below and to the right is filled with black. Example: a 300 × 200 pixel texture file is treated as 512 × 256 pixels. Texture Package menu To create user texture patterns, use the Texture Package menu.

The list Capacity shows the file size in units of 128×128 pixels (a total maximum of 64 units of texture files can be registered). c Directory selection button By pressing this button to display the popup window, you can select a directory on the memory card. d Texture file list This shows the texture files stored on the memory card. If a texture file is stored in a directory, press the directory selection button and select the directory in the popup window, to show a list of files. The list Capacity shows the file size in units of 128×128 pixels. e Grid display of memory capacity This shows how the texture files are stored in memory (an 8×8 grid, of 64 squares, each equivalent to 128×128 pixels). And this shows the location where the texture files are stored in memory by bold frames. The grid for the texture file selected in the texture number list is shown in amber. f Select button Pressing this button assigns the texture file selected in the texture file list to the number selected in the texture number list. g Delete button Pressing this button deletes the texture file assigned to the number in the texture number list. h Make Package button Pressing this button creates the texture package. Creating a texture package To use a user-provided texture pattern with the spotlighting function, it is necessary to convert the texture files to vector files for bump mapping. This operation is referred to as “creating a texture package.” 1 Insert the memory card holding the texture file into the memory card slot. 2 In the Engineering Setup menu, select VF1 ‘System’ and HF6 ‘Install/Unit Config.’ The Install/Unit Config menu appears; the status area shows the version information for the software installed on the various devices. 3 Using any of the following methods, select a DME for which the spotlighting license is valid. The MKS-7470X/7471X does not require license registration. • Press directly on the list in the status area. • Press the arrow keys to scroll the reverse video cursor. • Turn the knob. 4 Press [Texture Package]. If you select a device for which the spotlighting license is not enabled, then [Texture Package] is not enabled. 5 In the texture number list, select the number for which you want to register the texture package, by any of the following methods. • Press directly on the list in the status area. • Press the arrow keys to scroll the reverse video cursor. • Turn the knob. 5 Grid display of memory capacity 6 Select button 7 Delete button 8 Make Package button 1 The rest of the capacity 2 Texture number list 3 Directory selection button 4 Texture file list Notes Notes 152 Installation and Device Setup (Install/Unit Config Menu) Chapter 18 System Setup (System) 6 In the texture file list, select the texture file by any of the following methods. • Press directly on the list in the status area. • Press the arrow keys to scroll the reverse video cursor. • Turn the knob. a) The range of the setting values depends on the number of saved files on a memory card. 7 In the <Texture Pattern> group, press [Select]. This assigns the texture file selected in step 6 to the number selected in step 5, and updates the texture number list. The grid display of memory capacity shows the location where the texture files are stored in memory by bold frames. The grid portion for the texture file selected in the texture number list is shown in amber. 8 Repeat steps 5 to 7, to assign all of the texture files to texture packages. • If you assign a texture file that is already in the texture number list to a different texture number, then the previous assignment is deleted. (It is not possible to assign the same texture file to two or more different texture numbers.) • In the following cases, texture file assignment is not possible. - If there is no available memory space (“The rest of the capacity:0” appears) - If the selected texture file is too large to fit in the available memory space To delete a texture file assignment Select the texture file (multiple selections are not possible) you want to delete in the texture number list, and in the <Texture Pattern> group press [Delete]. 9 To create the texture package, press [Make Package]. A confirmation message appears. 10Select [OK]. The texture package is created in the same location that the texture file is stored on the memory card (extension: zsp, file name generated automatically). • If you remove the memory card on which the texture file is stored, it is not possible to create the texture package. • If a texture package is already present on the memory card, it is overwritten by a new texture package. • If you carry out steps 9 and 10 without having assigned even one texture file, it is not possible to create a texture package. • If there is insufficient space on the memory card to store the texture package, an error message appears, and the process is aborted. If this happens, delete unwanted files from the memory card using your computer, so that there is enough free space on the memory card, and repeat the process. (As a guide, the space required is approximately equal to total number of bytes of the texture files assigned in steps 5 to 8.) Installing the texture package 1 Insert the memory card holding the texture package into the memory card slot. 2 In the Engineering Setup menu, select VF1 ‘System’ and HF6 ‘Install/Unit Config.’ The Install/Unit Config menu appears; the status area shows the version information for the software installed on the various devices. 3 Press [Install].
