Below is an overview and guide for setting up. OVERVIEW: The new Evertz ProGuard system has been installed on the South side of the Video Delay Room. Once this has been signed off on, the plan is to build the identical set up on the North wall, completely removing the AirCleaner system currently in use. While some features may look familiar, the system is a bit more complex due to the versatility of use. There will be four stations in use. The South wall consists of Seats 3 & 4. The future build on the North wall will be Seats 1 & 2. Each station will have it’s own VUE touch screen for Delay settings, as well as a Corp PC available. A QC station will be in the center of each pair of Seats, where routing will be available to all monitors as well. Two large overhead monitors on each side can be configured for single use or multi view monitoring capability. CENTER VUE TOUCH SCREEN SETUP: There is a centrally located VUE touchscreen at the QC station where the Delay AUX can be selected for use. This selection should change the view at the individual Seat monitors. Note: this only assigns viewing. Assigning a Delay Seat Control Box to an AUX assignment must still be performed. PRGD IN: ProGuard In gives you access to the EXE router, where you can route the input to the individual Delay Aux’s. AUX Main is the input to the delay device. MONS: MONS gives you access to the EXE router, where you can route the input to any monitors in the system. VIPS: VIPS gives you access to the EXE router, where you can route the input to the multi monitor view inputs of the two large upper monitors. INDIVIDUAL VUE TOUCH SCREENS Swipe right to open the panel Begin by selecting the appropriate delay AUX/ station you will be working with from the top of the screen. You will be prompted to login in. No password is required. You will then have 4 options for settings (picture/sound/record/user) PICTURE: Picture assigns alternate video source for when delay is engaged. We would most likely choose AUX Input (for a safe shot or video black) or BLUR_EFFECT (60%) SOUND: Sound assigns alternate audio source for when delay is engaged. We would most likely choose MUTE or SPORTS_GARBLE. There is currently no use for us to swap audio channels with some of the other choices. RECORD: Record can be set to store an Audio/Video clip up to 10 minutes in duration. USER: USER settings control length of delay/ reaction time etc. NOTE these settings are in frames, not seconds. ASSIGNING BUTTON CONTROLS TO AUX’S Swipe right to open VUE panel. Choose CP ORCH (top righthand selection). No password needed to enter. Highlight appropriate Button Panel Selection (A,B,C or D). Under ProGuard Selection, Column 1 assigns Seat 1, Column 2 assigns Seat 2 (NOTE: when using pairs I.E Aux 911/912, you must assign both devices to both seats) ASSIGNING 2 DELAY OPERATORS TO 1 EVENT Swipe right to open VUE panel. Choose appropriate AUX and seat (AUX-911 1 for seat 1, AUX-911 2 for seat 2). Seat 1 delay should be set as follows: SNP DELAY Frames 72 / USER REACTION 24 Frames You must hit the “APPLY” button in order for settings to take effect Seat 2 delay should be set as follows: SNP DELAY Frames 48 / USER REACTION 24 Frames You must hit the “APPLY” button in order for settings to take effect IMPORTANT NOTE: System currently calculates @ 24 frames per second.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
