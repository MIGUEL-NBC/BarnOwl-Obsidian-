Frame Memory Block The frame memory block consisting of the MY-118 board and the CN-3235 board has 2-channel input and 16- channel output. MY-118 board and CN-3235 board (MKS-8440X) The MY-118 board has a function to store 2-channel signals in the SDRAM memory as still-image data and output stored still-image data in 16 channels (8 channels in the 3G format). The MY-118 board converts the 2-channel SDI signals sent from the XPT-31 or XPT-31A board to parallel signals, eliminate signal phase differences, performs video processing (including video level adjustment for each input), and then stores the video data in the memory. Output image data from the memory is converted again to SDI signals and are then sent to the XPT-31 board. The MY-118 board also has a function to bypass input signals to output without processing them to check images to be stored. This board is provided with a network interface for image transfer with devices connected to a LAN through the FM DATA LAN and a USB2 interface to read image data from and write image data to the external hard disk only for the frame memory. The rear CN-3235 board contains an FM DATA LAN connector and a USB2 connector. A single local CPU module (CPU-DP) on the MY-118 board controls the frame memory block.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
