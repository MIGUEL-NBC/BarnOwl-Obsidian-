This included an odd VUE Panel statusing issue in 3S Video and a handful of VIP/Multiviewer bugs we have been chasing since this Fall. See below for full list. Magnum- Router Service Upgrades Report-157- ACQ-SDVN Router Service Restart from 9/16 Report-167- Sources statusing incorrectly on VUE Magnum- Web-Multivewer Upgrades Report-151- Using the grouping feature defeats the ability to build a snapshot Report-164- Filter doesn't recognize capital letters when in Snapshot mode Report-165- Filter section needs to stay locked Report-166- Remembering which display is highlighted when leaving the edit mode We did extended testing with Control Rooms and Shared areas, but please be aware of any odd reports or issues and let us know right away. ***Please note that after this upgrade we noticed a very large number of the warning shields pop up on Destinations in SDVN. Usually these correlate to a sync issues between a sources and destination, but R&D assured us that there is nothing wrong with the sources/destinations. Of course, this could be misleading in SDVN, so we are going to continue working with them on this. Since they first implemented this feature, it was very unclear of its exact purpose, so hopefully now we can clearly get the full picture of this feature.
