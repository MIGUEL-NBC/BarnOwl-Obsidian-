Circuit Description 1-2-1. Camera System AT-177 board The AT-177 board is the microprocessor board that controls the camera block. 1. Microprocessor peripherals The CPU (IC209) uses SH2A (R5S7206), and the clock pro- vides 32 MHz from an external source that is six multiplica- tion in the CPU so that the clock runs on 192 MHz. The mem- ory is composed of 64 MBit flash memory (IC302, IC303), 16 MBit SRAM (IC3056), and 1 MBit FRAM (IC308). 2. A/D input of the CPU The A/D port equipped to the CPU is connected to the following signal lines and monitored: CC position, ND position, temperature, IRIS position of a camera lens, ZOOM position, and mic volume level. 3. Internal communication The serial communication includes intercommunication with the BleConSh IC on the DCP-49A board, the writing controls to the character generator IC, and intercommuni- cation with the disc. The parallel communication is equipped with the 8-bit data line, the total 11-bit address line (A0-A7, A14-A16), control line clock, XRD, XWR, OE, DIR, CS, and (QW- ERTY, ZXCV, TG). In addition, the intercommunication is performed with EEPROM on the DCP-49A board, the DAC and I/O port IC for the video signal, and the I/O port IC on the FP-157 board with the I2C line that is installed directly to the CPU. 4. Memory stick circuit The memory stick controller IC (IC610) is driven at 16 MHz, and the two-way communication and the clock signal are directly connected from the connector (CN602) to the memory stick connector of the MS-86 board via the coaxial harness. This is compatible with the Memory Stick PRO/DUO. 5. External communication The 2 channel serial communication driver CXD9093R (IC411) is equipped and performs external communication with the remote control unit RM-B150/B750. 6. ROM jig connector (CN601) The connector CN101 that can be connected to the jig for writing the boot program (MS-86 board) is included. DCP-49A board The DCP-49A board consists of the block for A/D conver- sion of the analog RGB signal from the PA-342A/PA-343A/ PA-344 board via the feedback clamp circuit, the camera DSP block that performs the signal processing, the driver block that sends the analog signal that is D/A converted to the outputs, and the I/F block to the AT-177 board. After passing through the prefilter (FL300 to FL302), the analog RGB signal input from the PA-342A/PA-343A/PA- 344 board is converted to 74 MHz rate 14-bit digital RGB signal by the A/D converter (IC107 to IC109), then input into the camera processor IC (IC600). The camera signal processor IC (IC600) detects the average value and the peak value of the camera video signals that are required for the AUTO operations of the camera such as AUTO black balance, AUTO white balance, and AUTO iris control. The detected average value and peak value are sent to the AT-microprocessor on the AT-177 board. In addition to the above operations, the 25/30 PsF conversion function and the 1080 to 720 conversion function are realized by using the DDR SDRAM (IC700 to 704). After passing through white balance, white shading, and flare correction, the camera main video signal performs the Digital GAIN UP, then performs the Digital Noise Reduction. Then, the matrix signal and the detail signal are added to perform pedestal control, gamma correction, knee correction, and white clip processing. After passing through the selector circuit with which either the camera main video signal or the color bar signal can be selected, the selected signal is output from IC (IC600) to IC800. The digital VBS signal and the digital Y signal for VF supplied from the camera signal processor IC (IC800) are converted into the analog VBS signal and analog VF signal by the D/A converter* (IC1513, IC1524, IC1525). After passing through the circuit with which either the camera analog VBS signal or the VF Y can be selected, the selected signal is output to the TEST OUT connector. After passing through the circuit with which either the GENLOCK IN connector input or the video signal can be selected, the selected signal is output to the VF connector. In addition, the sync separation circuit and the PLL circuit to synchronize with the external input video of the GENLOCK IN connector are included. The detected average value of the video signal detected in the camera signal processor IC (IC600) and peak value are loaded to the AT-microprocessor on the AT-177 board through the 8-bit data bus. 1-5PDW-F800/V1 (E) At the same time, various control signals are controlled by the AT-177 board via I/O Expander (IC3, IC4, IC67). All volumes are controlled electronically, and the level adjustment is adjusted from the menu. The main functions of IC800 are the down-conversion HD to SD, the conversion 720 to 1080 for VF output, and the VF DETAIL generation processing digital ECN processing. The camera main signal of the SD system is output to IC1000. After performing the multiplex and parallel-serial conversion on the character signal, audio signal, and the ancillary signal in IC1000, the HD signal and SD signal output from IC800 pass through IC (IC1112, IC1113) and are output to SDI1 and SDI2 connectors as the HD-SDI and SD-SDI signals. After another system performs scaling in IC1000 through the SDRAM (IC1309), the HD signal output from IC800 passes through the D/A converter (IC1518) and the video signal is sent to the LCD display. The HD signal output from IC600 is sent to the recording system (DVP-45 board) through multiple character signals in IC1000. After the signal from the RX-105 board on the SDI input option and the SDI signal from the 50-pin I/F are selected internally in IC1000, the signals are separated into the video signal, audio signal, and the ancillary signal, then sent to the recording system (DVP-45 board). * :The main functions of IC800 are the down-conversion HD to SD, the conversion 720 to 1080 for VF output, and the VF DETAIL generation processing digital ECN processing. The camera main output of the SD system is output to IC1000. 1-2-2. CCD Block PA-342A/PA-343A/PA-344 board The CCD drive pulses that are supplied from the TG-260 board are amplified so that these pulses can drive the CCD imagers directly (IC2: H Driver). On the other hand, the CCD output signals are amplified approximately two times and input to IC10. The video signal is drawn by the co-rel- ated dual sampling inside IC10 and GAIN UP of 0 to 12 dB is performed by the internal GAIN AMP. In addition, the differences in the CCD sensitivity are adjusted by adjusting GAIN. In addition to the above operations, the temperature that is detected by the temperature sensor (IC4) is converted to the voltage data and is sent to the AT- 177 board via the DCP-49A board. TG-260 board The pulses that drive the CCD imagers and the pulses that are used for sample-and-hold of the CCD output signals are generated by IC8 and are sent to the DR-617 board. These pulses are generated from the 74 MHz clock in synchronization with the HD VD signal input from the DCP-49A board. In addition, the TG-260 board has an interface circuit with the optical filter. DR-617 board The CCD drive pulses input from the TG-260 board and the sample-and-hold pulse are latched and output to the PA-342A/PA-343A/PA-344 boards. In addition, the DR- 617 board has the V driver of CCD. The CCD V sub voltage and CCD sensitivity adjustment data are recorded in the EEPROM (IC20). 1-2-3. Video Signal System DVP-45 board 1. Baseband/Video signal processing system <Recording system> The component parallel digital video signal supplied from the video circuit of the DCP-49A board is input to LVIS (IC400) of the DVP-45 board.

The 1 KHz square wave generated from the PWM genera- tor circuit inside the FP_CPU alarm tone is used as the alarm tone. 7. Wireless Receiver Control (Optional function) This communication circuit can control both analog and digital wireless receivers. Analog wireless receivers use the conventional method of synchronous serial communication (200 Bps). (Interval time: 80 ms) Digital wireless receivers use 38 KBps asynchronous serial communication to handle large amounts of communication data. With a built-in wireless receiver, when FP_CPU is in the POWER-ON state, the receiver type is determined and information such as the transmission RF sensitivity is load- ed. This data is transmitted to Camera CPU via ITRON (CPU) and can be viewed on the viewfinder. 8. Software download function FP_CPU has internal flash memory so the software can be overwritten.

The Serial Clock Rate is 88 KHz. The battery type, remaining time, and other information is loaded onto FP_CPU and transmitted to ITRON (CPU). ITRON (CPU) calculates the remaining battery charge and creates remaining charge display data, and transmits the data to Camera CPU and FP_CPU. FP_CPU displays the remaining charge display data on the monochrome LCD. The remaining charge display data can be checked at the same time in the status menu for the color LCD. 11. Power off software control circuit FP_CPU detects the POWER-SW OFF information. When power can be turned on, the \"Power OFF\" command is sent from ITRON (CPU) and FP_CPU controls the power OFF circuit on the CNB-25 board. 12. FP_CPU backup circuit Even when power is turned off for FP_CPU, the data is saved for the internal RAM and Real Time Clock (RX- 8025NB) through backup on a coin battery. By saving the system data, FP_CPU can be started up quickly when the power is turned on. 13. Backup lithium battery voltage measurement circuit FP_CPU performs voltage measurement on the backup lithium battery. When recharging is detected, the reduced- voltage information is send to ITRON (CPU). (Measurement interval time: 60 s) Current is prevented from running through FET-SW (Q836) in order to prevent power from being lost during measurement. Furthermore, reverse current above +3 V is prevented with FET-SW (Q829), thus extending the life of the lithium battery. The battery life is guaranteed for about 5 years. 14. FP_CPU independent operations When the POWER-SW is set to power off, power is supplied from the UNSW +12 V power circuit to display the counter and other information on the monochrome LCD. Power is supplied to each power regulator with IC830 (hyposaturation regulator 8 V) and independent operations can be performed. The operations can be turned on or off from the menu. 15.

REAR XLR automatic insertion detection circuit control (DET-47 board and sensor holder) Combine the DET-47 board on the sensor holder and connect with the harness to the AXM-38 board. The infrared light emitter uses one LED that connects to the CH1 and CH2 receivers positioned in the middle of the sensor holder on the left and right sides. When “Detection ON” is set from the menu and the XLR connector is inserted into the 3P-XLR connector, the infrared light is blocked, the output from the receivers changes from L to H, and insertion is detected. At this time, CH1 and CH2 operate automatically and the XLR input on the REAR area is selected. (CH3 and CH4 are not switched automatically. ) Detection interval time is 200 ms. 17. Color LCD monitor drive control and opening/rotation detection circuit The CN108 connector is connected to the power supply and the RGB signal for video, the passes through CN802 to connect directly into the LCD driver. FP_CPU and LCD driver are connected with synchronous serial communication. During POWER_ON, parameters such as brightness and contrast can be set. This informa- tion is saved in the LCD (PD-118 board) nonvolatile memory and the FP-157 board IC913 (nonvolatile memo- ry). Rotation is detected by the rotation sensor switch in DET- 45 after passing through CN802. Opening and closing is detected from the hole terminal (H801) on the FP-157 board and the field intensity from the permanent magnet (neodymium: Ne-FeB). 18. Nonvolatile memory control IC907 on the FP-157 board is nonvolatile memory that supports the I2C bus. This memory stores system information such as the A/D and D/A error compensation values and color LCD settings. During POWER-ON, this information is sent to ITRON (CPU) and the color LCD device. 19.

Digital Audio System DVP-45 board 1. Audio signal processing system <Recording system> The analog audio signal input from the AUDIO IN connector is converted into a serial digital audio signal (two channels) with the AUDIO A/D converter on the FP- 157 board. The digital audio signal enters CAVA (IC200) of the DVP-45 board through the MB-1111 board. The serial digital audio signal (four channels) input from the AES/EBU INPUT connector undergoes level conversion in the AXM-38 board and is input into CAVA (IC200) of the DVP-45 board. After the signal is decoded in CAVA (IC200), it is synchronized and converted to the same sampling rated as the recorded video signal with the sampling rate converter (IC700, IC703). Digital audio signals (eight channels) that include input HD-SDI signal (when the option is attached) are decoded with the DCP-49A board. Then, the signals are converted into serial digital audio signals and entered into CAVA (IC200) of the DVP-45 board via the MB-1111 board. CAVA (IC200) selects the above entered digital audio signal and sends it as the recorded audio data to AUDIO REC DSP (IC800). <Playback system> The playback digital audio signal that underwent playback signal processing in AUDIO PB DSP (IC801) is entered into CAVA (IC200), then separated and converted into the serial digital audio signals for analog output systems and digital output systems. The analog output system serial digital audio signal is sent to the AUDIO D/A converter in the FP-157 board via the MB-1111 board. After it is converted into an analog audio signal, the signal is output to the AUDIO OUT connector, headphone, and monitor speaker. The digital output system serial digital audio signal is sent to the DCP-49A board via the MB-1111 board. The signal is combined with the video signal in the DCP-49A board and output as the HD/SD-SDI audio signal. 2. Digital signal processing system <Recording system> The recording audio data from CAVA (IC200) undergoes signal processing such as recording level control, muting process, and MIX/SWAP in AUDIO REC DSP (IC800), and then it is sent to PIER G4 (IC1900) as recording digital audio data. The recording digital audio data is sent to AUDIO Low Resolution DSP (IC900) through CAVA (IC200), Proxy audio data is generated in compressed A-Low format, and the data is sent to PIER G4 (IC1900). The above recording digital audio data and recording compressed Proxy audio data are written PIER_SDRAM (IC1901 to IC1904). The recording digital data from the i.LINK/network is sent to PIER G4 (IC1900) via the PCI bus and written to the PIER_SDRAM (IC1901 to IC1904). While recording to a disc, the data in PIER_SDRAM (IC1901 to IC1904) is sent to the DR-606 board via the ATA interface. <Playback system> The audio data and the Proxy audio data are sent to PIER G4 (IC1900) via the ATA interface and written to the PIER_SDRAM (IC1901 to IC1904). The playback digital audio data in PIER_SDRAM (IC1901 to IC1904) is sent from PIER G4 (IC1900) to AUDIO PB DSP (IC801), After performing signal processing such as limiter, playback level control, and mute processing, the signal is input to CAVA (IC200). The audio data and Proxy audio data in PIER_SDRAM (IC1901 to IC1904) is provided to i.LINK/network via the PCI bus as the MXF file data. 3. Sync signal system The reference signal is always the 24.576 MHz clock entered from the DCP-49A board, whether recording or playing back.

FP_CPU sends the switch position information to ITORN_CPU of the SY-355 board, and then selects the audio signal by receiving the audio mode information from the ITORN_CPU. The selected CH1 and CH2 system signals enter the differential amp (IC5: balance-to-unbalance converter) and pass through the head room level switching circuit and balance-to-unbalance conversion amp for A/D. Then, the signals are applied to the A/D converter IC (IC102: 24-bit). The serial digital audio signal (2 channels) converted to digital is entered to VAX (IC200) of the DVP-45 board via the MB-1111 board VAX (IC400) selects the entered digital audio signal and sends it as the recorded audio data to AUDIO REC DSP (IC800). DSP for audio performs high-speed processing for operations such as gain processing during manual operations, AUTO processing, LIMITER processing, 67 Hz notch filter while using the front mic, LPF (15 KHz) ON/OFF, internal SG, and audio level detection. On the other hand, the front volume and side volume are connected to the A/D terminal in the CPU and the volume voltage is converted into digital with the internal 10-bit A/ D. After being converted into a multiplication value for DSP, the signal is sent to ITORN_CPU. ITORN_CPU performs operation processing on the combined front and side volumes and sends the results to DSP. The D/A serial signal for playback passes through the DVP-45 board and MB-1111 board and enters the digital switch (IC461) of the FP-157 board. In the monitor CH- SW, CH1&2 or CH3&4 is selected and applied to the 24- bit D/A converter (IC453). The D/A converter output passes through the differential LPF, ATT balance-to-unbalance conversion amp (IC514), and MB-1111 board. It is applied to the final amp (IC200, IC201) of the CNB-25 board and output from the 5-pin XLR connector (AXM-38 board). The audio signal for the monitor passes from IC520/620 output through the monaural, mix, and stereo switching switch (IC703, IC704). Then, the signal is applied to the operation amp (NJM2172) with electronic volume. The rear earphone can be switched between stereo and mono from the menu.

Optical Drive System Recording System Recording data sent from the DVP-45 board through the ATA bus (Ultra ATA33) is sent to the Blu-ray Disc Controller (BDC) IC300 on the DR-606 board. The BDC performs signal processing to conform to recording format, such as ATA interface, ECC coding and 17PP (Parity Preserve/Prohibit RMTR) modulation. The recording data is converted to multi-pulse in the BDC, and the multi-pulse data is sent through the flexible card wire to the optical block to be written into the disc. Playback System • Data Playback System The RF signal played back from the disc is sent from the optical block to the Front End Processor (FEP) IC200 on the DR-606 board where equalizing and asymmetry correction are performed after the RF signal passes through the AGC. After A/D conversion by the read clock played back in the PLL, the signal is sent to the BDC IC300. In the BDC, the signal passes through the adaptive digital filter, and Viterbi demodulation, 17PP demodula- tion, and ECC decoding are applied to the signal. Then the signal is sent through the ATA bus to the DVP-45 board as played back data. • Address restoration system The address data restored from the disc is sent from the optical block to the FEP (IC200) on the DR-606 board. The analog address data passes through the AGC and BPF and is converted to digital data in the FEP. The digital data is then sent to the BDC (IC300) for address decoding. The PLL in the FEP generates a wobble clock (WCK). Servo System • Tri-Axis Actuator and SA Actuator The object lens of the optical block is controlled for focus direction, track direction, and tilt angle by the tri axis actuator. The light reflected from the disc is converted to the electrical signal by the optical block. The electrical signal is input to the FEP IC200, and the focus error signal and the track error signal are detected. The SV DSP IC400 outputs the control data based on the errors to the driver IC501 and controls the focus actuator and the track actuator through the driver. The tilt actuator is controlled for its angle against the disc to be optimum based on the tilt adjustment result for the jitter of the playback signal to be minimum and the output of the angular velocity sensor. The SA actuator position is controlled for the spherical aberration to be optimum at the start-up adjustment when the disc is inserted. The SA actuator for the double layer disc is controlled to the optimum position every time to jump the layer. • Seek Motor The seek motor controls the position of the optical block so that the track to be recorded or played back is kept within the object lens driving range. • ND Filter The transmission factor of the ND filter is selectable to reduce the laser noise that occurs when the read power light is emitted for the single layer disc. • Spindle Motor The FG generated by the spindle motor is amplified and shaped on the SE-857 board, and is then input into the SV DSP IC400 on the DR-606 board. The SV DSP compares the FG frequency with the target frequency, and then controls the spindle motor via the driver IC500. System Control The SY CPU IC600 on the DR-606 board performs system control. It controls ATA interface, Data Manager, RF- related ICs, servo ICs, and loader. It also carries out interlocking control, maintenance and error log management of each device including the optical block. Firmware programs of the SY CPU and DSP as well as sources of each PLD are stored in the flash memory IC602, and the CPU loads them to each device when the power is turned on. The BDC IC300 and SV DSP IC400 are controlled by the parallel CPU bus, while RF-related ICs are controlled by the serial port through SYS PE IC700. Adjustment values and hours meter data are stored in the EEPROM IC4 on the SE-857 board. 1-17PDW-F800/V1 (E) 1-2-9. Power Supply Systems CNB-25 board The board checks the input voltage +12 V, and controls distribution of the input power to each circuit board. • Power ON/OFF Control The ON/OFF control is performed in IC1 and IC5. The IC1 input signals include L PWR SW ON signal, H POWERW HOLD signal, EXTDC detection signal, battery detection, excess voltage detection, and low voltage detection. During normal operation, when L PWR SW ON signal is turned to “L”, Q4, 5, 6, and 7 or Q11, 12, 15, and 16 are turned on, and the battery or EXT DC IN +12 V is supplied to respective circuit. The H POWERW HOLD signal is sent from the FP-157 board after the main power of this unit is turned on. Therefore, the power is kept on even if the L PWR SW ON (L) signal is set to OFF (H). In order to turn off the main power of this unit, the L PWR SW must be turned off (H) and the H POWERW HOLD signal must be opened and set to “L”. When the FP-157 board detects that the POWER switch is turned OFF, it sets the POWERW HOLD signal to “L” to turn off the power after a disc operation is completed if the equipment is in the midst of operating a disc. • Battery/EXT DC selector The EXT DC voltage is detected and either battery or EXT DC is selected with priority given to the EXT DC. The IC5 performs the control and Q4, Q5, Q6, and Q7 are turned on when a battery is selected and Q11, Q12, Q15, and Q16 are turned on when the EXT DC is selected. In this IC5, a step-up circuit (Vcc +8.5 V) that drives the N-CH MOS FET gate is employed. • Protection from Excess Input Voltage VOLTAGE DETECT (IC18) monitors the input +12 V. If the voltage exceeds approximately +18 V, the output of the IC18-1 is set to “H”. This is input to IC1 to start the protection from the excess voltage and turn on the +12 V output. (SHUT DOWN) Since this function is a latch operation, the main power of the unit needs to be turned off once and back on after the input power is set to below 18 V. • Excess current detection The output circuit of the UNREG +12 V has excess current detection resistors R70, R71 and R72. A voltage drop at the resistors is detected by the IC5. When the voltage drop at the resistors exceeds 200 mV, the +12 V output is turned off.(SHUT DOWN) Another SHUT DOWN signal is the H SHUT DOWN signal that is supplied from the RE-246 board. If any one of the DC-DC converter outputs is shorted, the output 12 V enters the SHUT DOWN state except UN SW +12 V. (SHUT DOWN) Since this function is a latch operation, the main power of the unit needs to be turned off once and back on after the cause of the excess current is removed. • Protection against input power connection of reverse polarity If the input power is connected in reverse polarity, FET (Q2) is turned off so that the GND lines of the control system circuits are disconnected. Thus the control circuits are protected and supply of +12 V power to the respective circuits is stopped. • FAN voltage control The Q13 and Q14 are controlled by the FAN CONT signal from the AT-177 board and the PWM wave is converted to the DC voltage according to the DUTY. The voltage controls the FAN and reduces the tempera- ture increase. • Audio Circuit This is the output circuit for the AUDIO OUT (rear connector). The signal is output by selecting the CH1/2 or CH3/4 in the MONITOR. • ± 4.8 V regulator circuit This is the voltage regulator for AUDIO using on the AXM-38 board. 1-18 PDW-F800/V1 (E) 1-2-10. LCD System PD-118 board The PD-118 board consists of the color LCD panel drive circuit and the power supply circuit for LCD backlight. IC1 is the color LCD panel drive IC that contains of the built-in video signal RGB driver, the timing generator, and the VCO. IC1 also contains the serial interface circuit and electronic potentiometers that are used to establish the various setups in accordance with the commands from the microprocessor (IC921) of the FP-157 board. The RGB video signals that are input to IC1 pin-37 through pin-39 receive contrast adjustment and brightness adjustment. Then, they pass through the output signal polarity inversion circuit and are output from IC1 pin-20 through pin-22. The factory adjustment data is stored in the IC3 EEPROM. The respective timing signals for driving the LCD panel are generated from the sync signals that are input to IC1 pin-41 and pin-42. The operations such as turning off the backlight and inverting the video signal left to right or up to down are performed in accordance with the control signals supplied from the microprocessor (IC921) of the FP-157 board. 1-2-11. Others CN-3005 board The VF power supply, light power supply, light switch signal, and the EEPROM circuit that stores the rely and system information of the handle switch signal are included. Handle switch relay Input and output the handle switch signal (CN2). Light switch relay Relays the light switch signal (CN3). EEPROM The system information is written to the EEPROM (IC2) by the I2C communication to control. MS-86 board The MS-86 board is the connector board for the memory stick connection. When a memory stick is inserted, the INS signal is set to LOW so that the camera microprocessor checks capacity and types of the memory stick inserted. VCC is supplied to a memory stick only when a memory stick is inserted or only when accessing a file on a memory stick. When VCC is supplied, the INS_LED and ACTIVE_LED (D1) is turned ON. Access to the memory stick data is processed in the following order: VCC IN → SCLK ON → BS Pulse → DATA IN/OUT → SCLK OFF → . . → SCLK ON → BS ON → DATA IN/OUT → SCLK OFF → . . → VCC OFF. 1-19PDW-F800/V1 (E)HeadRoomSW0dBXY_1dBTp1Tp2Tp101Tp201AK-538324bit A/DHeadRoomSW0dBXY_1dBTp3Tp4Tp301Tp401AK-538324bit A/DDifferential Amplifier(Balanced/Unbalanced)XYAK-4382A24bit D/ASWXYXYXYXYXYATT_17,_20,_24dBAMP10dB,20dB,30dBLINE IN : 4dBu+0dBu_3dBuMIC IN : _40dBu_50dBu_60dBuAES/EBUMIC IN : _40dBu_50dBu_60dBuXLR5PAMP10dB/20dB/30dBRS-422Receiver_3dBLPFI2S_FormatRX-101Analog-Wireless2ch Adapter_40dBu 25ZDigital-WirelessAdapter_40dBFSAUDIO_FORMAT:I2SORORXLR REARXLRFront0dBATT0dB_9dB_12dBCH2 : _15dBu+4dB0dB_3dBCA D12CA D34SRCAES/EBU D12AES/EBU D34Digital WRR D12Digital WRR D34AUD12AUD34VAXDE_MUXANA OUT D12ANA OUT D34Low Reso4chRECPBDSP(120MHz)TM320DA150GG120DE_MUXPBRec 4ch32BIT x 4chEE32BIT x 4chDigital OUT D12Digital OUT D34 PB 4chPB 4chDE_MUXI2C BUSPCA9555PCA9555MB-1111 MB-1111SWNJM368M4dBAXM-38CNB-25XLR 5POUTAXM-38FS64FSDigital WRR D12Digital WRR D34MA-162+SWNJM368MNJM368MCH1CH2CH1CH2FRONTHeadPhone&MONITOR_SPREARStereoHeadPhoneNJM2172VCA_95dBVR-ControlAudio System ControlFP CPUHD64F237814dBFP-157PCA9564AUDIOSELECTControlControlControlControlControlControlNJM2172VCA_95dBVR-ControlALARM-TONEHaedRoomATTCh2Ch1CN-3001ControlControl24bit_I2SLeftJustified24bitData Cnv.SWSWNJM2172VCA_95dBATT15dBATT15dBSWSWATT15dBATT17.5dBATT33dB_15dBuHeadRoom_12dB:ATT 8dB_16dB:ATT 4dB_18dB:ATT 2dB_20dB:ATT 0dB(Controled ATT of DAC)_3dBLPFXY0dBCH1 : _15dBuATT0dB_9dB_12dB4dB14dBDVP-45Audio Block Overview 1-20 PDW-F800/V1 (E) 1-3.

Structure of File System The PDW-F800 can save data modifications made in the setup menu, as files in the main unit itself and in a memory stick. The file system consists of the USER FILE, ALL FILE, SCENE FILE, REFERENCE FILE and LENS FILE. For details of each file, refer to “4-1. Setup Menus”. USER FILE The USER file contains the customized USER menu items and its setups. Up to 100 files can be saved in a memory stick. When this file is saved in a memory stick, the USER menu can be set instantly to the users’ preferred setup by reading the USER file data from the memory stick. ALL FILE The ALL file contains the setups of all menus. Up to 100 files can be saved in a memory stick. By saving the ALL file in a memory stick after adjusting the first camera, the user can instantly set the same adjust- ment setup as the first camera to the second and subsequent cameras by reading the ALL file data from the memory stick. SCENE FILE The SCENE file contains the setup value of the paint items adjusted in accordance with the shooting scene. Up to 5 SCENE files can be set in the built-in memory, and up to 100 SCENE files in a memory stick. When an operator saves the setup data optimized for a specific scene during rehearsal, the operator can establish exactly the same setup for the actual take as in the rehearsal by calling the saved setup data. REFERENCE FILE The REFERENCE file contains the setup values that serve as a reference for implementing SCENE FILE STANDARD. One file can be saved in the memory stick. LENS FILE The LENS file contains setup data that corrects the characteristics unique to each lens (flare, white shading, center marker position, white correction values). Up to 32 LENS files can be saved in the built- in memory, and up to 100 files can be saved in a memory stick. 5-2 PDW-F800/V1 (E) 5-2. Data Structure Each menu item can be classified into the categories of USER, OPERATION, PAINT and MAINTE- NANCE. In addition to these categories, each menu item has different data in the USER layer (not the USER menu), PRESET layer, SERVICE layer (not the SERVICE menu) and FACTORY layer. USER layer: Data layer that can be changed by menu operation. PRESET layer: Data layer to be registered as the standard setup. SERVICE layer: Data layer that can be changed by a service engineer after entering the Service mode *1. For users, this layer is identical to the factory default setup. FACTORY layer: Data layer that contains factory-adjusted values and fixed values. *1: Refer to “4-1-2. How to Display the SERVCE Menu” for entering the service mode. The USER layer, PRESET layer, SERVICE layer and FACTORY layer contain absolute values. The data in the USER layer, which is at the top, is used as the actual setup value. Regarding the items that change continuously such as DETAIL LEVEL (hereafter referred to as analog data) in the MENU display, when the data in the PRESET layer are changed by performing REFERENCE LOAD (refer to step 4 in 5-3-3) or a similar process that displays the differential values between the USER layer and the PRESET layer (USER mode), the MENU display changes according to the data in the PRESET layer. However, the values actually set do not change. In the Service mode, the MENU display for the analog data shows the differential values between the SERVICE layer and the FACTORY layer. Location where the data of each layer is saved: USER, PRESET and SERVICE layers: FRAM (AT-177 board) FACTORY layer: EEPROM (CN-3005, DCP-49A and DR-617 boards) and ROM (fixed value) USER USER layer PRESET layer SERVICE layer FACTORY layer PAINT FILE OPERA- TION MAINTE- NANCE SERVICEData Structure Menu 5-3PDW-F800/V1 (E) 5-3.

Gray-Scale Chart and its Maintenance Use of a reflective-type gray-scale chart (with reflectance of 89.9%) is recommended for the Gain adjustment. If a reflective-type gray-scale chart is not available, use a transparent-type gray-scale chart with a well-maintained pattern box. Calibrate illuminance (or luminance) on the surface of the gray-scale chart to the specified value as follows. Also, calibrate the color temperature to exactly 3200K by adjusting the illumination. Information on the reflective gray-scale chart (16:9) Availability of reflective-type gray-scale chart The reflective-type gray-scale chart (16:9) is commercially available. Chart : Reflective-type gray-scale chart (GS-HD of Murakami Color Research Lab. Inc. or equivalent) Available from : Murakami Color Research Lab. Inc. Notes on handling . Do not touch the chart surface with bare hands. . Do not rub or stain the chart surface. . Do not expose or use the chart under direct sunlight for a long time. . Do not leave or store the chart in a place that is very humid or contains toxic gas. . Do not place anything on top of the chart surface. . When a chart is stored for a long time without using it, open the case and leave the chart to dry for 30 minutes or 1 hour once or twice every month. Guideline of replacing the chart when used as the reference chart The reflective characteristics of the reflective-type gray- scale chart can easily deteriorate over time. As a guideline, the chart should be replaced every 2 years, but the replace- ment interval depends on the storage conditions of the chart. Luxmeter Light source Chart Setting Illuminance (In case of using reflective- type chart) Measuring equipment :Luxmeter (Minolta T-10 or equiva- lent, pre-calibrated) 1. Turn on the light source that illuminates the chart and allow it to warm-up for about 30 minutes. 2. Fix a luxmeter in front of the reflective-type chart. Obtain an illuminance of 2000 lx uniformly over the entire surface of the chart by adjusting the position and angle of the illuminations. n Place the light source at the same height and direction of the camera that shoots the chart surface. Setting Luminance (In case of using transparent- type chart) Measuring equipment : Photometer (Minolta LS-110 or equivalent, pre-calibrated) 1. Turn on the pattern box and allow it to warm-up for about 30 minutes. 2. Place the pattern box such that direct light does not fall on the chart surface. (Alternatively, place a cover the inside of which is painted with unglazed black, around the entire chart.) 3. Fix a photometer 1 m in front of the chart in the pattern box. 4. Obtain the luminance of 573 ± 6 cd/m 2 at the center of the chart by adjusting the BRIGHTNESS control of the pattern box. n Adjusting luminance of 573 ± 6 cd/m2 creates the same illuminance of 2000 lx on the reflective-type gray- scale chart with reflection of 89.9%.

RPN (Residual Point Noise) of CCD is usually corrected automatically (APR) during automatic black balance adjustment (ABB). When there exists RPN that is not corrected by APR, perform this adjustment. . This adjustment is performed on the MANUAL RPN screen or the MANUAL RPN (SLS) page in the SERVICE menu. Adjustment is performed using the MANUAL RPN page usually, but perform the RPN adjustment using the MANUAL RPN (SLS) page for the RPN that appears only in slow shutter mode (when “SLS: 2 FRAME” or more is selected.). Procedure is the same as that when using the MANUAL RPN page. Fixtures and Equipment: Color monitor Preparation: . Connect an HD color monitor to the TEST OUT connec- tor. . This is the setting for the RPN adjustment that appears only in slow shutter mode. SHUTTER switch (front panel) → SLS:2 FRAME or more . On the menu, set as follows MENU: SERVICE PAGE: MANUAL RPN (Standard adjustment) or PAGE: MANUAL RPN (SLS) (For the RPN adjustment that appears only in slow shutter mode.) Adjustment Procedure: n . All the adjustments are to be performed using the MANUAL RPN page or the MANUAL RPN (SLS) page on the SERVICE menu. 1. AUTO W/B BAL switch (front panel) → BLK (Perform the automatic black balance adjustment.) 2. Choose the channel (R, G or B) to be corrected. ITEM: TEST OUT SELECT → R, G, B This sets TEST OUT to output R, G, or B in HD. 3. Adjust the values of H and V. Then move the center of the cross cursor to RPN.

RPN exists. RPN exists in the Slow Shutter mode. Execute M21: APR of the MAINTENANCE MENU. Execute M21: APR (SLS) of the MAINTENANCE MENU. Perform section 9-2-10. S/H DC Adjustment. Perform section 9-2-9. RPN Adjustment. RPN is removed? The S/H DC adjustment is executed normally? No If an RPN extends over 2 pixels or more, change the RPN WIDTH in the range of 2 to 4, and execute re-registration. No No RPN is corrected? RPN is corrected? Yes No Yes Yes Correction OK Correction OK Correction OK RPN is corrected? Yes Correction OK Printed circuit board may be defective. Replace the printed circuit boards of DCP-49A and TG-260, and CHB block one after another to locate the cause of the trouble. NG under the adjacent conditions Possibility of NG under 7 line restriction. Delete registrations of peripheral small RPNs and execute re-registration. Correction is not possible. Replace the CCD block. No Yes Printed in Japan Sony Corporation 2009. 6 16 ©2009 PDW-F800 (SY) E 9-968-643-01","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
