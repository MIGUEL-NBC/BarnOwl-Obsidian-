This was done by NDI scan converting the VM and then routing the output (UTIL NDI 49) to the EXE sub called NOC LIST 01. ACI VM for Playlist Monitoring: Name: CPLAYX1-7N-95p4.vprod.io IP: 100.103.236.230 VNC Password: Vprodedit! On this VM, there is a Remote Desktop session that connects to the Morpheus playlist PC in Englewood Cliffs. There is a shortcut to the PC saved as an RDP desktop shortcut in case the connection gets lost. The username and password for the RDP session is snell and snell. Just in case thereâ€™s an issue with the shortcut, the EC PC IP is 100.116.100.63. The VM has NDI Scan Converter running which turns the desktop capture into an NDI source. The Newtek NC1 IO at IP 100.112.17.60, channel 7 is the one set to turn this VM NDI source into SDI. That turns into EXE source UTIL NDI 49.
