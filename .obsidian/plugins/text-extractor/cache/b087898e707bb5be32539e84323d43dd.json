Circuit Description Optical System Block (CCD Unit) PA-353 Board This board, consisting of a CCD drive H driver and a sample-hold IC, performs correlated double sam- pling for signals from the CCD and outputs them differentially. The sample-hold IC adjusts sensitivity. DR-632 Board This board consists of a CCD V driver circuit and a buffer for CCD and sample-hold IC drive pulses. TG-265 Board This board consists of the following circuits. . A PLD that generates CCD and sample-hold IC drive pulses and a video ampliﬁ er . A circuit to lock (using PLL) and synchronize the INT PLL H signal generated by the PLD with the PLL H X and PLL H Y signals sent from the DPR-298 board The master gain is switched with the step gain in the video ampliﬁ er. NR-80 Board This board performs CCD defect correction and black shading, etc. Signal Processing Block DPR-298 Board This board performs main camera signal processing for video signals. Video signals are digitized by the video ampliﬁ er and the A/D converter, and are transferred to the main process IC (IC401) through the pre-process PLDs (IC301 to 303) for video signal processing. The sub-process IC (IC501) and the PLD (IC701) perform video processing for the external interface. This board also contains a serial digital signal converter IC, an analog video D/A converter, and a refer- ence clock signal generator. CD-61 Board This board encodes the main-line signal and decodes the return signal and the prompter signal. Main-Line Signal The main-line signal processed on the DPR-298 board is encoded by the encoder and is transferred to the OFDM modulation IC. This IC multiplexes the main-line signal and the audio signal and a command sent from the SY-363 board to a 2-channel signal, D/A-converts the 2-channel signal, and then sends it to the TX-126 board. Return Signal This board receives the OFDM-demodulated stream signal from the TX-126 board, and divides it into a return video signal, prompter signal, audio signal for intercom, and a command signal. The return video signal is decoded to a baseband signal by the decoder, and is then sent to the DPR-298 board. The audio signal and the command are sent to the SY-363 board. 1-11HSC-300/V1 (E) Prompter Signal This signal is sent to the MPEG2 decoder on the ENC-112 board for decoding. In the case of the VBS prompter, the decoded signal is output from the VBS encoder (IC1201) on the CD-61 board to the SY-363 board. In the case of the HD prompter, the decoded signal is sent to the DPR-298 board. ENC-112 Board This small board is mounted on the CD-61 board, and compresses/decompresses the video signal for prompter. IC100 functions for MPEG2 encoding and decoding, but is used only for decoding in this unit. Signal Transmission Block TX-126 Board This board consists of a OFDM signal transmitter/receiver circuit for transmission of the video signal, audio signal, intercom signal, and commands, and an FM modulation/demodulation circuit for transmis- sion of the standby intercom signal, synchronizing signal, and TONE signal. OFDM Signal Transmitter/Receiver Circuit The OFDM signal output consists of six waves F1 to F6 to transmit video, sub video, microphone, inter- com, and command signals. The OFDM signal transmitter, consisting of two systems: LOW band (F1 to F3) and MID band (F4 to F6), ampliﬁ es the OFDM signal generated by the D/A converter on the CD-61 board independently for each band. The LOW band signal is mixed with the 1.4 MHz FM-modulated signal and is combined with the MID band signal in the MPX ﬁ lter (FL601), and then the composite signal is output to the CCU. The OFDM signal input consists of three waves F7 to F9 to transmit return video, prompter video, inter- com, PGM, and command signals. The OFDM signal receiver that is composed independently for F7 to F9 ampliﬁ es the waves F7 to F9 output from the HPF of the MPX ﬁ lter (FL601), selects them by band with the BPF (FL301, FL401, and FL501), and then processes them. The level of each signal selected by band is regulated by the step gain ampliﬁ er that automatically switch- es ampliﬁ er gain to four steps according to the input level and by the AGC ampliﬁ er (IC302, IC402, and IC502), and then the center frequency of F7 to F9 is converted to 36 MHz by the MIXER IC (IC303, IC403, and IC503). The converted OFDM signal is converted to TS data by the demodulator ICs (IC603, IC604, and IC605), and then the serial data is output to the CD-61 board. FM Modulation and Demodulation Circuits The FM modulation circuit mixes the standby INCOM signal (STB INCOM TO CCU: CHU → CCU) and the TONE signal (16.38 kHz), modulates (FM) the mixed signal with a carrier frequency of 1.4 MHz, and then sends the signal to the CCU. In the FM demodulation circuit, the FM signal (that is modulated with 1.0 MHz carrier frequency) is extracted from the RF signal sent from the CCU by the MPX ﬁ lter (FL601) and the BPF (FL2), and the FM signal is demodulated to a standby INCOM signal (STB INCOM FR CCU: CCU → CHU) and a synchronizing signal by the demodulator (IC13 LA2135M). The demodulated standby INCOM signal is output by the output ampliﬁ er at a signal level of 220 mVp-p (0 dBu input). The synchronizing signal waveform is shaped, and the signal is output with an amplitude of 3.3 Vp-p. The 1.0 MHz FM-modulated wave is detected by IC16 to check the presence of an FM signal wave. 1-12 HSC-300/V1 (E) System Control Block SY-363 Board This board comprises a CPU, peripheral devices, interfaces, a sync separator circuit, a video ampliﬁ er, and a audio circuit. CPU and Peripheral Devices The CPU runs on the program stored in the ﬂ ash memory (IC118, IC119). The program can be upgraded with a Memory Stick through the Memory Stick controller (IC128). The SY-363 board also comprises SRAM chips (IC122, IC123) and a FRAM chip (IC127) to record system setup data and other data. The CPU’s serial communication port is used to control the CCD block, serial lens, and the large-lens adapter. The analog input ports (AN0 to AN7) are used to read analog lens signals (Iris, Focus, Zoom, and Extend- er), temperatures of the CCD and boards, audio volume, and the servo ﬁ lter position. The CPU’s external bus (IC109, IC114, and IC125) is used to control the video signal processing LSI and PLD on the DPR-298 board and the communication LSI and PLD on the CD-61 board through the MB-1125 board. In addition to these, this board is provided with a calendar function RTC (IC108). BT101 and C118 function as the RTC backup power supply. 700 Protocol Communication IC145 performs 700 protocol communication between the camera and the REMOTE connector of the CCU. Data to be sent for communication with the CCU is multiplexed on the CD-61 board, and is then sent to the CCU. The REMOTE connector is shared with TRUNK, which are switched by the AT-PLD. AT-PLD (IC151) The AT-PLD is a PLD to control external inputs/outputs and the internal devices of the unit. The AT-PLD has the following functions. . I2C communication and 3-wire serial communication with the CCD block . I2C communication with the viewﬁ nder and tally output . I2C communication with the front boards . Inputs of rear panel switches, handle switch, and two rotary encoders . Tally output to the handle and TRACKER connector . D/A converter output for lens iris control . Servo ﬁ lter control . CPU’s V interrupt control . Communication with the character generator on the DPR-298 board . Fan speed detection . Monitoring PLD and power status on each board 1-13HSC-300/V1 (E) VDAP-PLD (IC655) The VDAP-PLD adjusts the phases of the genlock timing generator, SD sync signal, and HD sync signal, and controls the video selector, audio matrix processing, and the analog circuit (including the microphone ampliﬁ er). . Video block The video block has two functions: a sync separator circuit for genlock and a video ampliﬁ er circuit for the VF, TEST OUT, and PROMPTER connectors. The VF analog signal from the DPR-298 board passes through the LPF and is output from the VF connector and the BUILD UP connector. The VBS signal passes through the LPF and is output from the REMOTE connector (PIX output) and the TEST OUT connector. The SD sync and HD sync signals are phase-adjusted by the VDAP-PLD, and are then output from the TEST OUT connector. The same connector is used for prompter output and genlock input. When the CCU is connected, the connector outputs the prompter signal from the CD-61 board. When the unit is standalone, the connec- tor is used for genlock input, and the Reference-H, F signals are generated by the sync separator circuit and are then sent to the DPR-298 board. . Audio Processing Block This block is provided with input/output ampliﬁ ers and A/D and D/A converters for the microphone, intercom, earphone, and TRACKER, and a digital matrix to add signals. This block also has a standby intercom circuit for communication with the CCU in the standby state. The FRONT MIC connector or AUDIO IN connector is selectable for the microphone input, and only the AUDIO IN connector is compatible with the LINE-level input. The microphone input is provided with variable gain that can be switched within a range of -60 dBu to -20 dBu in 10 dBu step and +48V Phantom power supply. The microphone input is not compatible with AB POWER. The intercom input is provided with gain switching (-20, -40, or -60 dBu) and power supply (approx. 10 V) for carbon microphone. The TRACKER input is provided with gain switching (0 or -20 dBu). Each input passes through the pre-ﬁ lter, is A/D-converted, and is then input to the VDAP-PLD. The microphone and intercom outputs are switched and added by the VDAP-PLD, are multiplexed on the CD-61 board, and are then output to the CCU. Signals from the CCU are transferred to the CD-61 board and then input to the VDAP-PLD that performs signal addition according to each output and volume processing. Then the signals are output to the D/A converters for the intercom, earphone, and TRACKER. The D/A converter output signals pass through the analog LPFs and the output drivers, and are then output from each connector. In the standby state, the standby audio input (STBY Incom in signal) from the TX-126 board is adjusted for volume by the electronic potentiometer (IC603), and then becomes an intercom output. The mute circuit (IC588 to IC591) prevents the Triax-H signal from becoming an intercom output.

File Data at Adjustment The ﬁ le structure of the adjustment data of this unit is as follows. OHB File data Total adjustment data Scene Lens Reference . Lens ﬁ le is used for compensating the deviation generated by switching the lens extender from OFF to ON and for compensating the difference in the characteristics between lenses. This ﬁ le is stored in the camera. For electrical adjustments, mount the lens that is actually used. . The reference ﬁ le stores the custom paint data adjusted by the video engineer. This ﬁ le is stored in the camera and memory stick. Therefore, store this data in the memory stick ﬁ rst before starting adjustment, and clear this data from the memory stick after adjustment. . OHB ﬁ le is used for adjustment for the CCD block maintenance. This ﬁ le is stored in the camera. 3-1-4. Maintaining the Grayscale Chart It is preferable to use an 89.9%-reﬂ ective grayscale chart for electrical adjustments. If a reﬂ ective chart is not available, use a well-maintained pattern box and a transparent grayscale chart for adjustments. Before beginning adjustment, set the illumination of the light source (or the luminous intensity on the chart surface) properly proceeding as follows and set the color temperature to 3200 K exactly by adjusting light. Information on the reﬂ ective grayscale chart (16 : 9) Recommended chart The reﬂ ective grayscale chart (16 : 9) is commercially available. Product name: Reﬂ ective grayscale chart Supplier: MURAKAMI COLOR RESEARCH LABORATORY Handling precautions . Do not touch the chart’s surface with bare hands. . Do not subject the surface to dirt, scratches or prolonged exposure to sunlight. . Protect the chart from excessive moisture or harmful gas. . Avoid resting articles against the case. . When the chart is not used for a long period and is stored, open the case and dry the chart for about an hour once or twice a month. Replacement period when the chart is used as the reference The reﬂ ective grayscale chart should be replaced every two years if it used as the reference. Because the chart deteriorates with time and proper adjustment cannot be achieved. Replacement period varies depending on the chart storage condition. 3-3HSC-300/V1 (E) Chart Illuminance meter Light source Chart Luminance meter 1 m Setting illumination (when the reﬂ ective chart is used) Measuring equipment: Illuminance meter (Calibrated) 1. Turn on the light source and warm up for about 30 minutes. 2. Place the illuminance meter on the chart surface. Adjust the position and angle of the light source so that the whole surface of the chart is evenly 2000 lx. n Light the chart from almost the same direction and height as the camera to shoot the chart. Setting luminous intensity (when the transparent chart is used) Measuring equipment: Luminance meter (Minolta LS-110 or equivalent. Calibrated.) 1. Light the pattern box and warm up for about 30 minutes. 2. Place the pattern box where the chart is not exposed to light, such as a darkroom. (Or cover the pattern box with a cover whose inside is painted in black.) 3. Place the luminance meter facing straight to the chart at a distance of 1 m from it. 4. Adjust the luminance control of the pattern box so that the white portion in the center of the chart is 573 ?6 cd/m 2. n This corresponds to the luminous intensity on the 89.9%-reﬂ ective chart at 2000 lx. 3-4 HSC-300/V1 (E) 3-1-5.

The residual point noise (RPN) of the CCD is automatically compensated with the automatic compensa- tion (APR) function usually during the automatic black balance adjustment (ABB). If the RPN still remains after the APR is executed, perform the manual RPN compensation adjustment. . If any RPN still remains after the RPN compensation adjustment, handle it according to the ﬂ owchart. 3-6-1. Automatic Compensation (APR) When an RPN is detected in the screen, perform the automatic black balance adjustment (ABB) and remove the RPN with the APR function. m . RPNs of only one channel (R, G, or B) can be detected and compensated with one-time APR. To scan these three channels, be sure to perform the ABB three times. . The log of the address data of RPNs that have been compensated is updated each time the APR is performed. RPNs that are not detected with the APR function ﬁ ve times in a row, they are excluded from the scope of compensation and their data is deleted. 3-6-2. Manual RPN Compensation Adjustment The manual RPN compensation adjustment uses the SERVICE menu. For how to display the SERVICE menu, refer to Section 5-1. Open the MANUAL RPN[S03] page of the SERVICE menu. <MANUAL RPN> S03 TOP RPN CH SELECT : R RPN CURSOR : OFF CURSOR H POS. : 1008 CURSOR V POS. : 576 CURSOR JUMP : CURR RPN WIDTH : 1 RECORD RPN : EXEC DELETE RPN : EXEC Preparation . Perform the automatic black balance adjustment. 3-28 HSC-300/V1 (E) Adjustment Procedure n Points that are adjacent laterally and diagonally to already compensated RPNs cannot be compensated. 1. Select the channel (R, G, or B) that is to be compensated. ITEM:RPN CH SELECT → R, G, B 2. Adjust the H and V values and set the cross cursor center at the target RPN. When the cursor is placed accurately at the RPN position, the RPN is compensated. n Some RPNs seem to have been compensated even if the cursor is placed off the RPNs by one line or one pixel. Before proceeding to step 3, shift the cursor by one line or one pixel and check that the compensation position is correct. ITEM: RPN CURSOR → ON ITEM: CURSOR H POS ITEM: CURSOR V POS Reference One click of the rotary encoder is equivalent to one-pixel shift. On the other hand, the cursor moves by two clicks of the rotary encoder because the cursor has a size of two pixels. 3. Press the rotary encoder and record the RPN data (correction value). ITEM: RECORD RPN → EXEC 4. A message “RECORD DATA OK? YES → NO” appears. Check that the RPN has disappeared and then select YES with the rotary encoder. 5. Press the rotary encoder. A message “COMPLETE!” appears and the RPN compensation starts. n If a compensation pixel has been wrongly recorded, delete the RPN data. ITEM: DELETE RPN → EXEC 6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 to compensate other RPNs. If any RPN still remains after this manual adjustment, handle it according to the ﬂ owchart in Section 3-6-5. Setting after Adjustment ITEM: RPN CURSOR → OFF 3-29HSC-300/V1 (E) 3-6-3. Procedures to Be Taken When the RPN Compensation Fails When the RPN compensation is not successful even after the manual RPN compensation adjustment was made, the following causes are possible. . An adjacent wrong position was compensated. . The compensation failed due to the inﬂ uence of other RPNs. . The RPN with a very large level has an extent over one pixel that was made in the signal generation process. Checking Correction Points 1. Open the MANUAL RPN[S03] page of the SERVICE menu. <MANUAL RPN> S03 TOP RPN CH SELECT : R RPN CURSOR : OFF CURSOR H POS. : 1008 CURSOR V POS. : 576 CURSOR JUMP : CURR RPN WIDTH : 1 RECORD RPN : EXEC DELETE RPN : EXEC 2. Set RPN CURSOR to ON. 3. Check whether there are any compensated pixels close to the pixel to be compensated with the CUR- SOR JUMP function. Reference Correction points can be checked effectively by placing the cursor in advance close to the pixel to be compensated by using CURSOR H POS and CURSOR V POS. When the target pixel is above the cursor position, ITEM: CURSOR JUMP → PREV When the target pixel is under the cursor position, ITEM: CURSOR JUMP → NEXT 4. When the cursor stopped at a position near the target pixel (1) Delete the data because the data is recorded so as to compensate the pixel at the cursor position. ITEM: DELETE RPN → EXEC (2) A message “DELETE DATA OK? YES → NO” appears. Select YES with the rotary encoder and then press the rotary encoder. n Appearance of an RPN next to the pixel to be compensated means that adjacent RPNs exit. If an RPN appears in the diagonal direction, the RPN cannot be compensated. In this case, the CCD or the CCD block must be replaced. For more information, contact your local Sony Sales Ofﬁ ce/ Service Center. (3) If nothing has changed, change the compensation position. Move the cursor horizontally or vertically to check whether the RPN can be compensated. (4) When the RPN has been successfully compensated, record the data. ITEM: RECORD RPN → EXEC (5) A message “RECORD DATA OK? YES → NO” appears. Select YES with the rotary encoder and then press the rotary encoder. 3-30 HSC-300/V1 (E) (6) A message “COMPLETE!” appears and the data is recorded. n When two RPNs are vertically adjacent to each other, record the data at the position where one RPN can be compensated. Then shift the cursor vertically by 1 at the same horizontal address and check whether the other RPN can be compensated. When the other RPN has been successfully compensated, record the data of the RPN. When two RPNs are horizontally adjacent to each other, move the cursor to the position where the left RPN can be compensated. Next, set RPN WIDTH to 2 and record the data, and then check whether these RPNs can be successfully compensated. If the RPN compensation failed, delete the data.
