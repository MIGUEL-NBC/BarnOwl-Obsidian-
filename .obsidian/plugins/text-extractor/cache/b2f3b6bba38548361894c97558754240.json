{"path":"To Be Organized/30 Rock Global Infrastructure/Barracuda/Barracuda load balancer.docx","text":"As part of vacating 30R ER2F, two new Viz Frame Servers have been spun up in 30R ER7S. These frame servers are used to render still frame previews in the Vizrt Newsroom Plugin used inside iNEWS. The new servers are at 100.113.83.75 (VizFRAMESERVER5) and 100.113.83.76 (VizFRAMESERVER6). You can connect to them via VNC, and they are visible on the Graphics vCenter, studiomaint@vsphere.local login. Here is where they can be found in the event the VM needs a reboot: Since the VMs have GPU attached, you cannot use the VMware Console to access the console â€“ you must use VNC. These servers have been added to the load balancer that is accessed by all Vizrt Newsroom Plugin users, and are serving out previews effective immediately. The old servers have not yet been removed, so there is currently a total of four (4) frame servers for newsroom clients. If there are no issues, the old frame servers will be removed from the load balancer next week. Until the old frame servers are removed, all four frame servers need to be restarted when requested. As a reminder, IP Addresses of all four servers are: 100.113.83.60 100.113.83.61 100.113.83.75 100.113.83.76","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
