Removing the need/dependency on the GFX21 Router and allowing for a near future shutdown/decom. All GFX21 Router connections were replaced with Evertz IPG Gateways, allowing for direct connections to the PROD-EXE. All GFX21 Router Panels were also replaced with brand new Evertz VUE TOUCH2 Router Panels (Same panels as 6E). New GFX/ENG Resources are all controllable from PROD-SDVN and (2) dedicated Magnum Client Hosts Servers were implemented to host all the Salvos and Workflows for 71, 72, and 1A. In addition, a lot of work was done to integrate the CR 71, 72, and 1A Image Video Systems to the PROD- EXE Magnums, allowing for routing and callup status to be sent to Image Video system and for tally to be sent back to the PROD-EXE for VIP/UMD Tally.

Production Systems Infrastructure Bulletin- GFX21 Migration to PROD-EXE Launch- 6/15 Attached is my GFX21 Migration Project Playbook document. This excel consists of all new GFX Engine info, Router IO/Workflow info, and an overview of all implemented workflows created for these Migrations. You will see how we organized and broke out all the info on the bottom tabs. Please take a look and let us know if you have any questions. GFX Engine info for VIZ is always subject to change, so please continue to use your usual Viz Cheat Sheet doc from the Prod-App team and the vprod.io resource page, for all relevant GFX ENG info for support, troubleshooting, and reboots. All new ENG info was added to the first “NETWORK – ACI” tab by the Prod-App Team. Live Viz Engine Cheat Sheet: 30 Rock Viz Cheat Sheet VPROD Resource Tracker: production.vprod.io Should be everything I have on this! Let us know if you have any questions.
