Create Tally Manager DC List The Tally Manager DC List is used to define all of the Device Controllers (DC) used in your Tally Manager system. This list is used on the Input Table configuration web pages, as a “Source Device” drop down menu. It also is used to populate the Overview page on each unit. To create the Tally Manager DC List: 1) Click on the “System” link at the top of the page. A Log In prompt is displayed. Log in using the DNF provided user name and password. 2) Click on the “Tally Manager DC List” link. 3) Click on the “Add” link at the top of the web page. 4) In the Device Name field, enter a name, maximum 32 characters in length, that easily identifies the device being entered. This name is displayed in the “Source Device” column drop down menu on all the Input configuration web pages. Examples: “Area Router”, “PCR 1 Production Switcher” 5) In the Device Type field, select the type of device being entered from the pull-down menu. 6) In the Description field, enter a description for the device being entered, maximum 100 characters. This description is displayed on the Tally Manager DC List web page, and is only used for user information. It does not affect the operation of the system. 7) In the IP Address field, enter the IP address of the Device Controller connected to the device identified by Device Name. 8) In the Control Channel field, enter the channel number that the device is connected to on the DC20. 9) In the Backup Device field, enter the IP address of the backup DC that connects to the same device as the primary. The same channel number on the primary and backup DC must be connected to the device. If there is no backup IP address, do not include this parameter. 10) In the Location Typefield , select whether this device is used Facility-wide or is used within a single room. This will affect how the device is displayed in the Overview page. 11) In the Location Name field, enter a descriptive name for where the device is located. This location name will be displayed on the Overview page. This is used for user information only, and does not affect the operation of the system. Examples: “PCR 21”,”2nd Floor Equipment Room” 12) Press the “Save” button to save the entered device. Or press the “Done” to return to the previous page without saving the entered device.

The Channel Mode configuration web page is displayed. 4) Click on the “Edit” link at the top of the web page. 5) Select the appropriate channel mode (device type) from the drop down menu that describes the device connected to this DC channel. The available device types are Router, Switcher, Monitor Wall, Camera Tallies and Router with DA. For example, if a router is connected to Channel 1, select “Router”. NOTE: If Router is selected, each router output can assigned to only one production switcher or monitor wall Input. Select “Router with DA” to allow a single router output to be assigned to multiple Inputs. NOTE: Select “Camera Tallies” device type only on a channel with “Control Protocol” set to “Unassigned“. 6) Click on the “SAVE MODE” button to save selection, or click on “BACK” button exit without saving. 7) Click on the “Go Back” link to return to the Protocol Assignment Table web page. The “Unassigned” link is replaced with the selected channel mode. 8) Repeat steps 3 through 7 for each Tally Manager channel. Page 6 of 16 4.

Dynamic – Video source originates on another device. NOTE: To set all Inputs to Fixed, press the “Set All to Fixed” button. This will affect all Inputs on the router, not just those within the selected range. 7) If Fixed is selected, enter the System Source Name (SSN) for that Input, OR leave the System Source Name field empty to use the System Source Name obtained from the router. In the Alias column, select the Alias mode for that Input from the drop down menu: i. Disabled – No alias is allowed. Only the System Source Name will be displayed on the UMD. ii. Local – A local alias may be assigned to this Input on a monitor wall that displays this Input. The alias will only affect the monitor wall where it is configured. iii. Global – A global alias may be assigned to this Input at the router. The alias will affect all monitor walls that display this Input. iv. Local Overrides Global – Local and global aliases may be assigned to this Input. If a Local alias is assigned, it will override a Global alias that has been assigned. Page 8 of 16 8) If Dynamic is selected, select the Source Device from the drop down menu and enter the Output Number that the Input is connected to. If the Source Device is a router, also enter the Level for that Output Number. 9) Repeat steps 6 through 8 for all Inputs as necessary. 10) Press the “SAVE_ALL” button to save the entered changes, or press the “Back” button to return to the previous page and discard all entered changes.

Page 11 of 16 6. Configure Monitor Wall Inputs Table A monitor wall may be made up of multiple multi-viewer cards, each individually controlled over an Ethernet connection. Tally Manager “sees” all of the multi-viewer cards as one control channel, on the Device Controller. In the Protocol Assignment Table, in the PHY CFG column, select EDIT to enter the IP addresses for each of the cards used. Ethernet PHY Configuration 1. Enter a unique Card Label for each card. (TSL V5 protocol requires a separate entry for each card output.) 2. Enter the card’s IP address. 3. Enter the card’s IP address. (Consult the card manufacturer’s documentation) 4. For TSL V5 protocol only, enter the screen number. (Consult the card manufacturer’s documentation.) Page 12 of 16 Monitor Wall Inputs Table Each UMD line in the Input Table has three (3) entries: UMD Source Device identifies the router or switcher output that feeds the UMD input. UMD# identifies the UMD on the monitor wall Left Tally (Primary) Source Device identifies the switcher or other device output that indicates that the UMD source is on-air, in-record, or in-use. When this tally is “ON”, the UMD text is red. Left Tally# identifies the controlled tally object on the monitor wall. Right Tally (Secondary) Source Device identifies the switcher or other device output that indicates that the UMD source is in-record or in-use. Right Tally# identifies the controlled tally object on the monitor wall. 1) Launch your web browser and enter the Device Controller’s IP address. The DC Home Page is displayed. 2) Click on the “Protocol Assignment” link at the top of the page. The Protocol Assignment Table is displayed. 3) On the Protocol Assignment Table, on the Monitor Wall Channel row, in the “Tally Manager Config” column, click on the “Inputs” link.
