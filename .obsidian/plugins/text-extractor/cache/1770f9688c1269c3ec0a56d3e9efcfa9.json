A simple button press or GPI Input generates pre-configured SNMP message or SNMP Trap. Pre-configure Set/Get, OID, and Value for each button. Send messages to one or more destinations. The LCD face on each button provides text and color for easy to read system status and alerts. Displayed information can be easily tailored for operator expertise and responsibility. Multiple status messages can be prioritized for each button. The USP3 makes it easy to give operators the specific control they need to do their job. Use multiple USPs for primary and backup control points, for front line and supervisory positions, multiple control & monitor locations. Setup and Configuration is Easy Use a standard web-browser to configure the USP3. Assign OIDs and Values to each button for control and tallying. Assign destination IP address and text & color for each button. Simply select from drop-drown menus and fill in text boxes. Make changes quickly and easily. No reboot required. Configuration is saved in USP3's non-volatile memory. Using web-browser, save configuration to your computer, restore configuration from computer. Copy configuration to other USP3s.
