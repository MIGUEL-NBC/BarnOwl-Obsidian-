However, Operators discovered one bug today that prevents at home operators from changing the virtual joystick tilt-direction control. This does not impact functionality and we are continuing to work with Vinten to solve this ASAP. Operators worked throughout the afternoon to continue testing, rebuilding shots for 4E, and creating documentation to help inform/train the other Ops. Since we are currently in the middle of an upgrade migration of all the studios (3A/3AW left), Remote Ops work in a hybrid environment. Dialing into additional Vinten Servers for 4E/4ETS on their RDM interfaces. Once the project is complete, any Operator can access any studio from any workstation onsite or remote. Just wanted everyone to be aware and incase anything pops up. We are standing by tonight with Vinten incase Operations have any issues into the morning with Early. James, I added you to that Teams invite just in case its needed tonight. Will keep everyone updated on progress. Thanks!
