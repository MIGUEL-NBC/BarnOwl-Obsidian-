{"path":"To Be Organized/30 Rock Global Infrastructure/RTS/7S ENT Frame Reboot.docx","text":"FYI, At midnight, Jon, Abhi, Nick D, & I were asked to power down & then power up the 4 ENT frames located in 7S-ER-096 & 097. The process involves individually powering down all four units & then powering on again once Bob Streeter gives the order. We also checked to make sure the Automatic Override was turned on. When the units powered back on we waited several minutes to check that the 1st of 2 System Controller Cards were set as the primary (they are the last two cards in each frame). The point of having the 1st card set as the primary is to ensure a level of quality control. To failover from one card to the other you have to hit the reset button on the top of the card that is enabled. While resetting this will then failover to the other card. After the rebooting the frames we had to failover the secondary card to the primary card on frame 4. It should be noted that the bottom four LED lights on the System Controller Cards flicker once an update/power cycle is ran to display that they are communicating. Once they slow down it is safe to test the individual RTS panels. Attached is a picture of the System Controller Cards. Once the rebooting process was complete we tested each panel in all of the CRâ€™s using the ENT frame. The Control Rooms on the ENT frame are: CR 71, 72, 7A, & 6E Plaza Productions. We also tested the satellite rooms such as their ACR, GFX, & video rooms. All panels tested as working. Let me know if you have any questions.
