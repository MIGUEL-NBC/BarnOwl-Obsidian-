You can operate on individual files or registers, or together in a batch. Regarding frame memory, it is possible to capture image data stored in an external device into frame memory. You can also convert the format of image data in frame memory into a different format and save it in an external device. Files that can be manipulated The following files can be saved and recalled. • Operation mode setup data for system as a whole and individual devices • Device status data for system startup • Key memory setting data • Video process memory setting data • Keyframe effect setting data • Snapshot setting data • Wipe snapshot setting data • DME wipe snapshot setting data • Key snapshot setting data • Shotbox setting data • Macro setting data • Macro attachment data • Menu macro setting data • Frame memory image data • List of files automatically created in a frame memory file backup to DDR/VTR (single data set) • User setup setting data • User source name setting data File operations You can carry out the following file operations. When operating on individual files or registers Save: Save the data in a register to the hard disk or memory card. Load: Load a file from the hard disk or memory card. Copy: Copy a file within a directory or from one directory to another. When a remote panel is used, this function applies to it, too. Rename: Rename a file on the hard disk or memory card. Delete: Delete a file from the hard disk or memory card. When operating on files or registers in a batch The Save, Load, Copy and Delete operations are performable. Notes on transferring multiple frame memory files together to a memory card • Transferring all of the files within frame memory together fails if the capacity of the memory card is too small to hold all of the images. In this case, replace with a larger capacity memory card, or delete files until saving is possible. The following table roughly shows the relation between memory card capacity and number of files that can be saved. Note that when transferring to the hard disk, there is ample capacity, so that problems such as this do not occur. • If you cancel the operation during a data transfer between frame memory and hard disk or memory card, then an image which was not completely transferred will not be reproducible. Avoid canceling such operations. • When loading a file from hard disk or memory card, if [Freeze Enable] in the Freeze menu is on, the loaded file may sometimes be overwritten by the frame memory input image. To avoid this when loading a file, ensure that [Freeze Enable] is turned off. Memory card capacity Number of files that can be saved SD system HD system (except 720P) 256 MB 214 46 123Overview of File Operations Chapter 17 Files Importing or exporting files to or from frame memory Import: Import a file in a different format from hard disk or memory card into frame memory after changing its format. Export: Export a file in a register to hard disk or memory card after changing its format. You can import TIFF, BMP, and TARGA files as follows into frame memory. a) Windows is a registered trademark or trademark of Microsoft Corporation in the United States and/or other countries. This functionality has been tested and confirmed to work with TIFF files created by Photoshop, but it may not be possible to use TIFF files created with some other software. (Photoshop is a trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated.) About import image size Pay attention to the following, depending on the signal format which you use. SDTV (480i) Images 720 × 487 pixels in size are exactly the size which fills the full screen. The following figure shows how an import image is processed when the 480i/59.94 format is used. Images are placed with the upper left of the screen as the origin. When an image is smaller than the screen, the remainder of the screen is filled with black. When it is larger, parts which extend beyond the screen are discarded. No pixel ratio conversion is performed when images are imported for the SDTV format. When the signal format is 480i/59.94, if you create an image with a size of 720 × 540 on a computer and then import it just as it is, the image will be too tall. To maintain the shape of the image, first create it as a 720 × 540 image and then use computer software tools to compress the vertical dimension to 487 pixels before importing it. HDTV (1080i) Images of 1920 × 1080 pixels in size are exactly the size which fills the full screen. Like SDTV, images are placed with the upper left of the screen as the origin. When an image is smaller or larger than the screen, processing is the same as for SDTV. Since the pixel ratio of the HDTV format is 1:1, files created on computers are imported in their original shapes. The following table shows the image sizes which exactly fill the full screen for the various signal formats. File type Format File name Notes TIFF file RGB uncompressed format Maximum eight characters, plus extension .tif required • Layers cannot be used. • If an alpha channel is present, two files are created as a pair. BMP file Windows a) 24-bit format Maximum eight characters, plus extension .bmp required – TARGA file RGB uncompressed/ compressed format Maximum eight characters, plus extension .tga required • Layers cannot be used. • If an alpha channel is present, two files are created as a pair. PNG file RGB compressed format Maximum eight characters, plus extension .png required • Layers cannot be used. • If an alpha channel is present, two files are created as a pair.

(E.g.: consecutive numbers from 0000) Directory operations You can create a new directory within a hard disk or memory card, and carry out other operations, such as renaming and deleting (see page 135). File copying between different unit IDs Switcher and DME files within the hard disk or memory card are managed by unit ID. To copy files between different unit IDs, use the Unit ID Copy menu (see page 136). Saving data recalled by autoload At power on, you can automatically recall data previously stored on the hard disk. (Autoload function) The following data can be loaded by the autoload function. • Keyframe effect setting data • Snapshot setting data • Wipe snapshot setting data • DME wipe snapshot setting data • Key snapshot setting data • Shotbox setting data • Macro setting data • Macro attachment data • Frame memory image data To use the autoload function, the data required must first be saved (see page 145). For details of saving operations, see “Setting Automatic Loading of Register Data at Power On (Autoload Function)” (page 146). Locking file recall operations For each of the following categories, in setup you can apply a lock on recalling files (see page 155). Setup, Initial Status, Key Memory, Video Proc Memory, Effect, Snapshot, Wipe Snapshot, DME Snapshot, Key Snapshot, Shotbox, Macro, Macro Attachment, Menu Macro, User Setup A locked file cannot be downloaded from the File menu. 720P/50 1280 × 720 720P/59.94 Signal format Image size (H × V) 125Operations on Individual Files Chapter 17 Files Operations on Individual Files You can save or load the contents of an individual file or register.

In the Frame Memory menu, the following items are also shown. Pair: In the case of a pair file, “P” is shown. Ext: In the case of an extended clip file, “Ext” is shown. Selecting Regions You can carry out a file operation on a number of regions simultaneously. However, a region selection is not required for the following files. • Key memory • Video process memory • Shotbox •Macro • Macro attachment • Frame memory •Setup • Initial status •User Setup • User source name In the above list, for setup and initial status, you can similarly separate the files to be operated on by device in a way similar to the region selection. To make a region selection 1 Press the region selection area at the top right of the screen (see page 126). The region selection window appears. 2 Press the region names you do not want to select, turning them off. 3 Press [OK]. Selecting a Device for Operations To carry out file operations, you need to specify the device holding the data (or file), as one of the following: register, hard disk, memory card, and so on. You can then further select a directory. If you have enabled NFS (Network File System) in setup, you can add “Network” to the device for operations. If you specify “Network,” you can access System Manager through the network for file saving and loading. For details of the NFS settings, see “Making the Network Settings” (page 139). • Files saved on the hard disk may be lost if the hard disk fails. Always keep separate backup copies of important files on a memory card. • Format a memory card before using it for the first time (see page 154). As an example, to select a memory card, use the following procedure. 1 In the File menu, press the device selection indication above the file list (default is [HDD] (hard disk)).
