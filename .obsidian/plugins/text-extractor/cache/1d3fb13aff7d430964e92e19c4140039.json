{"path":"To Be Organized/Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Touch/New Digital Interactive Workflow.docx","text":"Originally, hits were hosted in VideoFlow itself, now it acts as a router to send the app located on another server to the various touchscreens in the building. It is set up so that each touch screen has its own unique URL to load hits. Iâ€™ve created shortcuts on the desktop of the most commonly used screens, 3A, 4E Production Center, 4E Townhall, 1A Weather You will be using the Digital Interactive Chrome shortcut on the desktop rather than the VideoFlow link (renamed VideoFlow Old.)
