They use a control machine (3dPlay) and rendering engines for output (HDVG.) Note: These screenshots are from an unused PC and HDVG. On the 1ANNBackup orad (social media orad) you only need to connect the Social Media engine. Use as a reference only. On the control machine, first verify the G drive is connected and accessible. Then open 3dPlay Server and Start it. The icon in the task bar will turn red when ready. Then open the 3dPlay application and connect. Once open, the operator will know what production to open, but it is usually the most recent item in Files>Recent. Once the production is loaded, the rendering engines will appear on the bottom of the window. You can hover over them to get the IP address. Left clicking will allow you to connect to an engine. If the engine is up and running it will turn green. Once connected, on the top of the window, select on-air, and Load All. In the pop-up window, the connected engine will turn green once loaded. Other engines will stay red. Close this window, and the engine is ready to receive instructions. Restarting the HDVG To restart an hdvg you must connect to it using ssh command line. Open the PuTTY application, and double-click the IP address of the engine you need to work on. In the command line window log in as root. There is no password. To restart, type 'shutdown -r now'. Omit the -r argument to shutdown completely. From this point you can send a continuous ping to see when it comes back. When you can ping it again, reconnect the same way and log in as root. To start the rendering engine, type these commands. Directory locations are case-sensitive. cd /data/RE/bin (Enter) ./start.sh (Enter) Once this finishes, press CTRL+D to close the window. You can then reconnect the engine in the 3dPlay application.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
