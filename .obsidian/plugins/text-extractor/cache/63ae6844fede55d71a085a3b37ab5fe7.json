DVP-24A Board In contrast to the DVP-24 board for BKDS-9470, the DVP-24A board supports the multi-format and performs the SD signal processing for only one channel. Some functions such as combine processing are performed on the VIF-28 board. The DVP-24A board consists of the control block and the signal processing block. The control block consists of the sub CPUs A and B. Both sub CPUs receive the commands from the main CPU (on the CA-54CFA board) through dual port RAM (IC3801,3909), and control the signal processing blocks through BOOT_PLD (IC108). The FPGAs of both of the sub CPU A and the sub CPU B are controlled via FPGA_IF (IC107). The sub CPU A mainly performs the non-linear and background processings, and the sub CPU B performs the other processings. The respective sub CPUs start up by the 1st boot of its flash memory, then have the applications started up by the 2nd boot of the booting flash memory (IC4001,4002) on the DVP-24A board. The BOOT_PLD (IC108) performs configuration of the other FPGAs on the DVP-24A board using the address decode to the peripheral devices of the sub CPU and using the configuration data that is stored in the configuration flash memory under the control of the sub CPU A. The configuration data and the applications that are stored in flash memory are newly rewritten when the installation work is done by the compact flash card of the main CPU. The signal processing block consists of the six FPGAs: Pre Video Modify (PVM), Filter (FLTR), Address Generator (ADRS), Interpolator A (INTPA), Interpolator B (INTPB) and Mixer (MIX). The abbreviated names shown in parentheses ( ) are used for description below. The respective FPGAs have the following main functions. (1) PVM (IC101) · Input TBC · Border/Crop/Beveled Edge · Video Modify (Posterization, Solarization, Mosaic and other) · Input Freeze (2) FLTR (IC102) · Antialias Filter (Horizontal and vertical directions) · Scan Conversion · Field/Frame Conversion · Defocus/Blur (3) ADRS (IC106) · 3D Linear Transform · Non-linear (4) INTPA/B (IC103,104) · Interpolation · Lighting (5) MIX (IC105) · Recursive · Graphics (Generate Only) The signal flows are as follows: The video, key, and external video signals from the VIF-28 board are received by the LVDS receivers (IC701,702,703). Then, these signals are sent to PVM (IC101). In PVM (IC101), these signals receive the signal processing such as Input TBC, Input Freeze using the DDR SDRAM (IC1401,1402), Video Modify, Border/Crop/Beveled Edge, and then the Video/Key signals are sent to FLTR (IC102). In FLTR (IC102), these signals receive the filtering processing (antialias filter) in accordance with the Defocus/Blur in the horizontal direction and with the compression ratio. After that, these signals receive re-arrangement (Scan Conversion) using the DDR SDRAM (IC1901,1902) and also receive Defocus/Blur in the vertical direction and the antialias filtering processing. These signals then receive the Field/Frame Conversion using the DDR SDRAM (IC2101,2102,2201). The output data are sent to INTPA/B (IC103,104), where they are stored in ZBT SRAM. In INTPA/B (IC103,104), data is read from ZBT SRAM according to the address generated by ADRS, and the interpolation processing is performed. In INTPB (IC104), the Video/Key signals receive the lighting processing, and are then sent to MIX (IC105). In MIX (IC105), the Recursive processing using the DDR SDRAM (IC3201,3202,3301,3302) and superimposition (Graphics) for coordinate axis display are performed so that the Video/Key signals and the Graphics data signals are sent to the VIF-28 board using the LVDS transmission via the LVDS transmitters (IC801,802,803,804).","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
