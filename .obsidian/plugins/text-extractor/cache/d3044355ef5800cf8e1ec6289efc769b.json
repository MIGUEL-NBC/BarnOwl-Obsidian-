First save all files for the system using File Menu #7161. It is recommended to not only save to the internal Hard Drive but also save to an External USB Memory device. Also save all Frame Memory Data. 2. Go to Menu #7314 and set the Power On mode to Custom and select FACTORY for Setup and Init Panel for each Device (PNL, SWR, DME). The changes will appear in yellow text so then press the EXECUTE button in the lower right of the Menu Display. 3. After putting the software on a USB Memory device, then go to menu 7317 and press Refresh so the USB device gets mounted then select that mount device that appears in the table and press Primary. NOTE: Never power cycle any of the Devices during a Software Load. Wait until the end of this procedure for instructions on how to Power cycle the devices. 4. Go to menu #7316 and press Install. It may take several minutes for the Software files to scan and load, depending on how much data you have on the USB. 5. After the Install menu appears, there is an upper table consisting of all the devices in the system (MENU, PNL, SWR, DME, DCU). The lower table shows the software available for download for the device selected in the upper table. Always start with MENU first. NOTE: Never press Display all button, as this will allow showing all software applications to appear in the lower table and an incorrect software type could accidentally be selected.ONLY press the SET and EXECUTE buttons in the Install menu. 6. You may select each Device in the upper table then select the software to load from the lower table and press SET. Normally you do not have to execute for each device individually. You may select SET for every device, being VERY sure you have selected the correct item in the lower table first, then after selecting SET for each device press EXECUTE will load all device software. NOTE: I recommend you always select FULL and not upgrade for the software item in the lower table. When software is loaded successfully a window will appear on the Menu Display that states Software Loaded successfully. If you get an error or you do not see the Software Load Successful window, please call SONY Service immediately. 7. The SWR device is unique, in that it requires loading two software items from the lower table. However, you can only select and load ONE item at a time per Device. The two items for the SWR are: TITLE MVS8000X Proc. [V12.00] (for full install) TITLE MVS8000X-FPGA upgrade [V12.00] (V11.1 to V12 upgrade) ONLY after both these software items have been loaded, where each indicated Software Load Successful, then is it recommended to proceed. NOTE: If you are upgrading from V11.10 or below, the CPLD data also must be upgraded. This requires specific tools and JTAG data. Please contact a SONY Service representative for this procedure. 8. After every device has loaded software successfully, you can then proceed to do a Shutdown and cycle power on each Device frame. Select the PAGE button in the upper left corner of the Menu Display and a window will appear that has an orange Shutdown button. Press the Shutdown button and wait until the Menu Panel goes Black and there are no characters on the Menu Display. Then Power Off the SCU (MKS- 8010/A/B). Leave the power off. Power OFF each Device Frame and wait a few seconds then power ON. Make sure each Device frame boots up and all indicators are green. NOTE: If any LED indicators on any of the Boards in the Frames are RED please call SONY Service immediately. Power ON the SCU last after all other devices have been powered ON. 9. When the SWR boots up and initializes successfully with no errors then go to menu #7316 and verify all Devices software versions. Each device Detail information should also be verified against the REL_NOTE data to be sure all items were upgraded to the correct version. NOTE: According to Tech Bulletin 202010148 it is recommended to perform ALL CLEAR by Dip Switch. This is only necessary if the Menu Panel MKS-8011/A locks up after reboot or during operation. It does not hurt anything to perform this procedure. However, it is absolutely necessary to follow the steps in the Tech Bulletin in order to configure the System menu’s 7311, 7312.1, 7312.2 and 7313. 10. LOAD all files using menu #7161. Also load all Frame Memory data as required. NOTE: After a software upgrade it is necessary to Load and Save all User settings, whether they are stored on internal Hard Drive or external USB memory. If a file from a previous version is loaded and edited without converting it to the new version by Saving it first, then the result may cause the switcher to hang up. 11. When the system operation has been verified, go to menu #7314 and set the Power On mode to Custom and select USER for Setup and Init Panel for PNL and SWR only. USER setup for the DME is an option at the discretion of the customer and is not recommended unless the user has confirmed certain DME setting are required that are not default. The changes will appear in yellow text, so then press the EXECUTE button in the lower right of the Menu Display. If you want to have the current loaded file to power on with these settings, then press the Setup Define button for each Device. In other words, select PNL then press Setup Define. After it completes the configuration, then select SWR and press the Setup Define. NOTE: Menu’s 7311, 7312, and 7313 do not change by loading User setup data files.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
