Below is a description on how you the user can access them for the EZTV interface on your desktop. In the event you have an issue please call: 212-664-7724 for our Maintenance Department. Thank You. Typing: http://iptv.inbcu.com/EZTV will show you the EZTV player where you can browse channels to watch using the primary server. In the event you have problems accessing this primary iptv server try typing http://iptvbu.inbcu.com/EZTV in the same address line of the browser. This will give you access to the secondary iptv server. Provided you donâ€™t have any WAN issues to the corporate network you should see the EZTV player allowing you to access all the channels to watch. In the event both addresses are not responding please call for technically support at: 212-664-7724 for the Maintenance Shop. Thank You!","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
