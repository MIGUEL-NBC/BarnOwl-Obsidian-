On Monday at approximately 1:19PM on the PROD-X-EXE, the EXE Frame Controllers simultaneously disconnected from all active (20) Line Cards. This is what resulted in the brief loss of Calrec I/O Audio connections to the EXEs and the VIP inputs failing over, which resulted in all the PIPs flashing green. The disconnect was momentarily and all the Line Cards quickly reconnected to the EXE Frame Controllers, which reenabled the streams back on the PROD-X-EXE and stopped the issues. The Evertz Team have determined that this is due to a bug in the Frame Controller software and they are working on an immediate code fix and release to resolve for good. From the last update we received, R&D has sent the initial new Code build to the factory to start the mandatory burn-in period before official release. In parallel, we are also exploring with them additional monitoring of the systems and any additional mitigation steps we can take while they work on the code fix. Please let me know if there are any questions as we continue to work with and push Evertz to get this all resolved.
