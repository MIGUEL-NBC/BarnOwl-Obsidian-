Company Confidential Introduction ▪ The evBLADE contains a SW and four Compute Nodes that provide unmatched processing capacity. One example of a deployable pipeline on a single node is a 7814UDX–2 dual path 3G/HD/SD Up/Down/Cross conversion with frame synchronization, color correction and noise reduction along with a rich feature set of audio processing and ancillary data processing. This provides the equivalent of 4x 7814UDX–2 modules on a single evBLADE - doubles the density of a fixed function 7814UDX–2 installation. ▪ The evBLADE supports a growing library of software licensable and deployable core video/audio/ancillary data processing services, making it a future–proof platform to meet not only the needs of today, but also the needs of tomorrow. The evBLADE will support technologies like SMPTE ST 2110 and High Dynamic Range (HDR) conversion Company Confidential evBLADE–4Z10–10G–HW Block Diagram Company Confidential SFP Company Confidential evBLADE–4Z10–10G–HW Top view Company Confidential Front and rear plate Company Confidential Bring up with SW FW 3.7 •First step to bring up the EVBLADES is to setup the IP’s on the SW and the (1)4 compute nodes. •We will need a USB serial cable (USB to mini USB) •Teraterm settings: Company Confidential Bring up with SW FW 3.7 ▪ Connect the cable USB to mini USB on the front panel mini USB port ▪ On Teraterm Enter “customer” for Login and password , and then press the <enter> button.

As mentioned before, upgrading firmware can be done through System\\ Firmware Upload section. ▪ evBLADE-4Z10-10G-HW has 1 Switch and 4 Compute nodes, the Switch and Compute Node base firmware (OS linux base) are different. ▪ The Switch Firmware image is noted by SW in the file name for example: evBLADE-Z10-SW.tar.gz ▪ The 4 Compute nodes have base firmware, license and Packages. ▪ Compute node Firmware image is noted with CN in the File Name: evBLADE-Z10-CN.tar.gz. ▪ At the moment, 3 different services (Packages) can be load to the Compute nodes: ▪ ▪ VPROC: Video proc/color correction support including RGB.YCbCr. ▪ DUAL-UDX: Two video paths supporting Up,Down and Cross conversion. ▪ IP-DELAY: 1- 4 paths of video/audio delay ▪ DOLBY PROC: DDE ,DDE Audio PROCS only for APCN(3RU) Company Confidential Loading SW base firmware ▪ Go to the web browser and type the SW IP address Company Confidential Loading SW base firmware ▪ Click on Firmware Upload ▪ Click on browse ▪ Look on the directory for a file similar to this evBLADE-Z10- SW_02_05_git_4a1dfd0.tar.gz ▪ Click Upload. Company Confidential Loading SW base firmware ▪ If the upload succeeded will show a message Firmware uploaded on a green background. ▪ Click the X to closed it. Company Confidential Loading the Node firmware ▪ On the web browser type the node IP: Company Confidential Loading the Node firmware ▪ Click on Firmware Upload ▪ Click on browse Company Confidential Loading the Node firmware ▪ Look on the directory for: • a bundle file or (evBLADE-Z10-CN_01_07_git_206c168- VPROC_1_6.tar.gz) only Telemundo • for a base firmware (evBLADE-Z10-CN_03_13_git_b96ce37.tar.gz ▪ Click Upload. ▪ If the upload succeeded will show a message Firmware upload on a green background ▪ Click the X to close it. Company Confidential Loading a license ▪ Only the 4 nodes need the License this are depending of the package customer purchase. ▪ Licenses are create with serial number of the node ▪ Click on System Tab ▪ Click status ▪ Under Board info section, we will find the serial number Company Confidential Loading a license Company Confidential Loading a license ▪ On the webpage click on License Tab ▪ Click on License Upload Company Confidential Loading a license ▪ Click on browse ▪ Look on the license directory for the name and the serial number that the license was created Company Confidential Loading a license ▪ Click Upload. ▪ If the upload succeeded will show a message License uploaded on a green background ▪ Click the X to close it.

Company Confidential 404 Not Found/nginx/1.8.1 ▪ That is happening when the sw or the CN’s are loaded with a production test FW. This code doesn’t have webpage interface. ▪ What to do? ▪ Open winscp and start a New Site using FTP as file protocol. Make sure this ftp and not sftp or scp. ▪ Type the IP address for host name and customer/customer for user/pass Company Confidential 404 Not Found/nginx/1.8.1 Company Confidential 404 Not Found/nginx/1.8.1 ▪ As you save and login, a location will open and the firmware has to be copied into this location.(drag it to the right pane) ▪ After FW had been copied ,Reboot the EVBlade Company Confidential Computer cannot access the EVBLADE ▪ Make sure you add the right gateway/genmask ▪ What to do? ▪ 1-)You can set your laptop to the same network as the EVBLADE ,on the browser ▪ Go to System/network/eth a or b and add the right gateway/genmask Company Confidential Computer cannot access the EVBLADE ▪ Make sure you add the right gateway/genmask ▪ What to do? ▪ 2-)set the right gateway/genmask on the serial port ▪ bulk/ethA/set stactic interface/set stactic Gateway(FW 3.7) Company Confidential Computer cannot access the EVBLADE ▪ Make sure you add the right gateway/genmask ▪ What to do? ▪ 2-)set the right gateway/genmask on the serial port ▪ Bulk change/settings/network/etha/gateway/Genmask (FW 3.8) Company Confidential SW FW 3.9 cannot set the IPs ▪ If we have SW FW 3.9 and we try to set the ips the serial port show a error message ▪ This is happening because the sw has FW 3.9 and it is compatible only with CN FW 3.12 and above. ▪ What to do? ▪ load SW firmware 3.7 ▪ Powercycle the EVBLADE and setup the ips ▪ Make sure you have CN fw 3.12 and above, ▪ Upgrade the CN and the SW to the latest FW through their webpage. Company Confidential License is loaded but package is not responding ▪ When we click on the packages Tab and choose a package cannot be activate. ▪ What is happening somehow the package and license folder are corrupted. ▪ In that case we need to erase the content on the folders using commands: ▪ rm -rf /opt/evertz/evEDGE/licenses/* ▪ rm -rf /opt/evertz/evEDGE/packages/* Company Confidential Not BW IP-in/output ▪ Magnum routed the input multicast but there is not BW on the output.
