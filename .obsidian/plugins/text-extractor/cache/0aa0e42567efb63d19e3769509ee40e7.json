Registering the Lens File The white shading which occurs when the extender is turned on, flare balance, white balance, F value of the open edge of the lens, name, etc. can be stored. Up to 16 files can be stored. The adjustment data can be called by selecting the lens file. This data will be stored in the camera. As for the items to be stored, refer to Section 4-8,“ File Items”. The lens file stores the differential data from the reference file. m . Prior to creating the lens file, perform the necessary adjustments by using the lens normally used to create the reference file. . As for the setup menu, refer to Section 3. Adjusting the Lens File (1) Mount the lens. Select the file with the same name of the lens mounted from the setup menu. If no file with the same lens name, select “NO OFFSET”. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [No.] → (Select the No.) (2) Set the lens file name and F value of the open edge of the lens. (3) With the lens extender set to OFF, adjust V modulation of R/G/B/Master. Shoot the all white pattern, set the iris F4 and zoom position to the center of the ring, and perform the adjustment around 560 mV of 80% video level. Also adjust the flare balance and white balance shooting the grayscale chart. (4) Store the data in the lens file. Set the setting menus as follows. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [STORE|FILE] (5) Set the extender to ON, adjust the V modulation of R/G/B/Master shooting the all white pattern, and adjust the flare balance and white balance shooting the grayscale chart. (6) Store the data in the lens file. (7) If the lens center deviates when the lens extender is switched to ON/OFF, store the center marker under the extender is ON state. Adjust [CENTER|H|POS] and [CENTER|V|POS] at the [LENS|FILE] page, and execute [STORE|CENTER]. n The center marker will not be stored when the lens file is stored. Calling the Lens File Select the lens file set by the setup menu as follows. [OPERATION] → [LENS|FILE] Initializing the Lens File Set the setup menu as follows. All data of the lens file being currently selected will be initialized to the factory setting values. 4-10 (E) HDC-900/950 IMM 4-7. Registering the OHB File 4-7. Registering the OHB File The OHB file is used for storing the maintenance adjustment values of the CCD block and the data will be stored in the camera. The data can be stored using the setup menu or the MSU (master setup unit). The items to be stored are the black shading, white shading, ND offset and OHB matrix. n As for the setup menu, refer to Section 3. 4-7-1. Storing the Black Shading and White Shading Storing Using the Setup Menu (1) Execute the setup menu as follows. [FILE] → [REFERENCE] → [STANDARD] (2) Change the items to the desired value; H SAW, H PARA, V SAW and V PARA of each R/G/B for each of white shading and black shading. (3) Set the setup menu as follows. [FILE] → [OHB|FILE] → [STORE|FILE] Storing with MSU (1) Change the items to the desired value; H SAW, H PARA, V SAW, V PARA of each R/G/B for each of white shading and black shading. (2) Press “STORE” of the OHB file. HDC-900/950 IMM 4-11 (E) 4-7. Registering the OHB File 4-7-2. Adjusting the ND Offset The white balance may be slightly deviated in the ND filters. In such cases, adjust the offset. Taking the ND filter 1 white balance as the reference, the ND offset stores the deviation of the white balance of ND filter 2, 3, 4. Adjusting the ND Offset (1) Set the setup menu as follows. [FILE] → [REFERENCE] → [STANDARD] (2) Connect the waveform monitor to MONITOR OUT connector of this unit. (3) Select ND filter 4, and shoot the grayscale chart. Check that the illuminant condition is under that video level is within 560 mV thru. 630 mV. Then note the video level at this time. n Do not adjust the ND offset if the video level is less than 560 mV. (4) Select 1 by the ND filter knob, and set the iris so that the video level is the same level as the noted video level of Step (2). (5) Execute the auto white balance. (6) Select 2 by the ND filter knob, and set the iris to meet the noted video level of Step (2). (7) Execute the auto white balance. (8) Select 3 by the ND filter knob, and set the iris to meet the noted video level of Step (2). (9) Execute the auto white balance. (10) Select 4 by the ND filter knob, and set the iris to meet the noted video level of Step (2). (11) Execute the auto white balance. (12) Store the ND offset. Execute the setup menu as follows. [FILE] → [OHB] → [STORE|FILE] m . Adjust precisely to meet the noted video level, otherwise the deviation of the white balance of the ND filter may generate in some cases. . If the level cannot be adjusted properly using the iris, adjust the level using the shutter/ECS or gain-up. Calling the ND Offset When the ND filter is changed, the ND offset will be called automatically. Initializing the ND Offset Execute the setup menu as follows.
