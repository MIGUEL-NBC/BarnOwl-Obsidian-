These indicate the “Time to Complete Playback Start” and should all be < 100 milliseconds. Times larger than this they could be noticed and times approaching 1 second or more would definitely be noticed. Elevated TCPS values can result from: - fragmented database = run a unique rebuild - slow disk = use Windows Resource Monitor to check disk queue length, should always be <1 (should be like 0.1 or less)   - disk fragmentation = run disk defragmenter utility - failing disk = check Windows System Event log for disk errors, check RAIDcontroller if applicable, replace disk - network issues = check Windows System Event log for network errors - elevated CPU utilization = use resource monitor to watch CPU utilization, should always be <50% or so, if high use task manager to find offending process It is also possible that there is a serial port issue or DADpad issues but this is unlikely. If suspected, watch the F10 (debug) screen for TCPS times when you play a cut with a mouse then with the DADpad.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
