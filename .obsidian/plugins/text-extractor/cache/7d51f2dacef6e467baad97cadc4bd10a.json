AES67* to AES67* • TDM or MADI ports Max 10x in and 10x out • 512 channels pre TDM • 64 channels per MADI • Purchasable options for DANTE modules (8x max per frame) • VistaLINK® capable for remote monitoring and conﬁ guration via SNMP • Local web conﬁ guration page • Main and Redundant Power Modules and Supply The 9821EMR–AG–HUB is a 1RU platform that is optimized for operation in 10GbE and 25GbE IP SDVN environments, supporting SMPTE ST 302M, AES67*, TDM, MADI and DANTE (up to 512x512 channels of Dante). With TDM connections it can externally support AA, AES, EQX embedded audio, HYDRA2 and ALINK. The 9821EMR–AG–HUB provides a gateway to link IP infrastructures with discrete audio IO directly and by using any of the existing Evertz TDM enabled Audio interfaces. It has a number of functional use cases including translating between AoIP standards including SMPTE ST 302M, AES67* and Dante, for audio bridging between devices supporting SMPTE ST 302M or AES67* to a common core IP audio format. AES67 to AES67 for proﬁ le grooming*. Bulk audio connection between audio systems such as connecting multiple mobile broadcast vehicles that are using EMR audio router modules.
