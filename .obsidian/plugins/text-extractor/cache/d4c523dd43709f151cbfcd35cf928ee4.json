(Snell Advanced Media www.s-a-m.com) Send triggers to Morpheus to execute pre-defined actions. Receive triggers from Morpheus to control devices connected to the GTP-32. Safely and easily give operators manual control over automation actions without accessing the actual automation client. Provide manual override for late-breaking events. Also, use triggers from Morpheus to enable / disable manual control. Cut playlist complexity by mapping standard triggers from Morpheus to different GTP-32 actions and devices. Use automation triggers to drive text-to-voice adapters, countdown-to-air & countdown-to-break time displays, In-Break or In-Program tallies, and other useful tallies. Easy Setup Use a standard web browser for mapping GTP-32 events to pre-defined Morpheus OR map Morpheus triggers to drive GTP actions. Simply choose options from the drop-down menus and complete the text boxes to configure. Create multiple configurations for special events, weekend staff, or temporary needs.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
