It will be updated with more information as we continue building out the second half of the room. At this time this document will focus on general room setup and Aux 911 and 912 paths which are used for Sports Coverage. Censor Delay Cheat Sheet 7N_Central_Delay_Playbook_v1.xlsx Default settings: Sports Picture: Blur Effect 60 Sound: Sports Garble Entertainment Picture: Blur Effect 60 Sound: Mute\t Routes CR PGM > Aux 911 Main > Aux 802 > Aux 911 IP CR PGM > Aux 912 Main > Aux 804 > Aux 912 IP System Overview Censor path flows left to right in room. There is a total of 72 frames or 3 seconds of delay on left side, and 48 frames or 2 seconds on the right. The two sides of the room work in tandem. To set up delay room, route CR PGM feed into Aux 9XX Main subscription via VUE panel The physical button controls are used by ops to trigger censoring Vue panel in center of room runs “salvo” to set up Aux Main routes as needed 911/912 921/922 931/932 are all redundant pairs, but need manual routing Aux 911/912 is for Sports Aux 921/922 is for Entertainment The censor delay room is used during live events to censor audio and video as needed to prevent profanity or nudity on air. This system is used most frequently with sports controls. It can be used for any application as needed. There are several Aux paths used for this system. These paths will be used for specific shows. Aux 911 and 912 are specifically used for sports. We also have Aux 921, 922, 931, 932 but these have not been built out yet. The Aux pairs can be thought of redundant pairs. So, Aux 911 and Aux 912 would have the same feeds but slightly different paths in case we have issues with one or the other. 921 and 922; 931 and 932; etc. Let’s get into how the room is physically set up. There are 2 positions on each side of this room. The left side pictured above are Positions 1 and 2. These are all very thoroughly labeled. On the left side of the desk is Position 1. This position monitors the direct PGM feed via a subscription called Aux 911 Main. Each position also has a local corporate PC installed. There are also PCoIP thinclients here, but these are for future use and not currently active. On the right side of the desk is Position 2. This position monitors the same PGM feed with a bit of delay. The center QC monitor has the 2nd delay post position 2. This post all delay feed is called Aux 911 IP. Of course, the feed will change based on which Aux you are working with. For the remainder of this guide we will be focusing on Aux 911. Both positions also have a 16 channel Wohler to monitor audio. This allows us to see all possible channels of audio across all productions. Reminder that at this time, MSNBC program has a tick on channel 13. Now that we have gone over the physical setup, let’s get into the routing setup. The signal flow for the censor delay goes left to right. Let’s go over the path for Aux 911. The left monitor (dest: 7N MON 7D03 L) would have Aux 911 Main routed to it. Aux 911 Main is the container subscription that directly feeds into the Evertz ProGuard delay units. So the feed you route into Aux 911 Main is the feed that enters the delay units. The left monitor is used to monitor the direct CR PGM feed. So in this case, Aux 911 Main would have a CR PGM feed routed into it like CR 71 0 or CR31 PGM LIVE based on whatever PGM feed is used. The center monitor (dest: 7N MON 7D QC B) has Aux 911 IP routed into it. Aux 911 IP is the final post delay source. This would be the feed that you would look at or provide if anyone needs the post delay feed. This would also be the feed that is sent out for distribution. The right-side monitor (dest: 7N MON 7D04 R) has Aux 802 routed into it. This might be the most confusing part of this signal flow. Aux 802 is fed by the output of the left side censor delay. This output then is what feeds into Aux 911 IP. Together these routes look as follows; CR PGM > Aux 911 Main > Aux 802 > Aux 911 IP Let’s get into how you would make these routes. In between the left and right positions, there is a horizontal style VUE panel mounted in the desk. This panel helps to facilitate all of the above-mentioned routing. When looking at the setup tab on this VUE panel, you can trigger macro’s that work like salvos. When you select the Aux Main it will route the appropriate subs to each of the 3 monitors we mentioned above (Left, QC, Right). It will also handle control of the delay units accordingly here. The PRGD IN tab refers to the Aux Main subs mentioned earlier. This is the destination that feeds into the ProGuard delay units. You can see what an expected route would be here for 911 and 912 when using CR 71. The Mons tab refers to the local monitor routes. You can change the routing into each monitor in the room, but you will not be doing this often. The important route in this tab will be for MON 7D MW 03 which is highlighted here. This is referring to the top left monitor and will need to be rerouted when switching between AUX paths. The VIPS tab allows you to route into the local 7D01 VIP which is typically routed into the top right monitor. You have all your VIP destinations here. A quick note about the Aux feeds, as seen here you will see 3 feeds. Aux 911/9XX is legacy and should be ignored at this time. Aux Main is the uncensored PGM feed. Aux IP is the final post censor feed. When changing routes you need to hit the red take button on the right. That concludes the overview of the main operation side functions. Let’s now enter some backend stuff. The following information is to be used only when necessary. There are things you can change here that we do not want to. The appropriate settings for each Aux will be documented here as we continue building things out. The backend configuration can be accessed via the 2-standalone desk VUE panels found on the left and right sides of the room. These panels are accessing the ProGuard configs and will allow you to change settings on the ProGuard units directly. These changes are all manual and at this time do not have salvo’s to set. When first looking at the panel you would expect to see the above. You can look at the tabs to select the configs for each position. Aux 911 1 refers to position 1, and Aux 911 2 refers to position 2. When running a different macro/salvo from the VUE panel on setup tab, the position will flip to whichever AUX is selected at the time, 1 refers to the controls on position 1, and 2 refers to the controls on position 2. To log in, at this time just hit submit on the password page. This will bring you to the config page for that position. When you first hit submit, you will see the above screen. This is normal, just wait about 30 seconds or so and the screen will update. Here you can see the main configuration for these Pro Guard units. Let us go over the settings from left to right within the system. Here in the VUE panel, hitting the red circles labeled Picture/Sound etc. will trigger the system same as hitting the physical buttons. On the Picture tab (look top left) we can pick what type of picture adjustment we want to apply when hitting the Video delay button. For Sports, the selection is blur effect 60. These can all be set independently for each AUX. Eventually, we can have 911/912 set for sports, 921/922 for MS/News, 931/932 set for Entertainment. These are subject to change but 911/912 will be saved for sports. Ideally, we won't be changing these. In the sound tab, just like in Picture, you can adjust the type of audio censor. For sports, we use sports garble. This tab allows you to record clips to use for the video censor called loop or safe shot. You can have a single clip recorded and loaded at a time (this will change in future versions). You can adjust the time of record here as well, and pick the source from PGM and AUX. This is mainly an operator function, but you should know how to do it in a pinch. The final tab is an important one to understand. In this tab you can select various specific user settings. Let’s go over what these numbers mean. This is a section that should never be changed, without Steve Earles, Leo Machado, Dan Guild or Atalay Akat approvals. If this is changed ensure a full end-to-end fax is done. The SNP Delay refers to the number of frames of delay for each seat. This (72) is equivalent to 3 seconds of delay (24 frame per second). On Aux 911 1, you would expect to see 72 frames. On Aux 911 2, you would see 48 frames. This is because 911 2 is downstream of 911 1, and we are never dealing with more than 3 seconds of added delay. AUX path delay and Record path delay are expected to be set to 3 frames, the lowest we can go. User reaction time refers to 1 second of reaction time (24 frames) that’s built into the system to account for human reaction. This means that when you hit the video delay button, the blur effect will affect the video stream 24 frames or 1 second before you hit the button. Let’s now move to the final element here, CP ORCH found on the top right corner. This can be a little confusing but shouldn’t need to be used very often. Within CP ORCH you can adjust which physical control buttons are hitting which ProGuard units. Here you can adjust which AUX each controller is controlling. You will not need to do this unless someone messes this up or there are issues. Adjusting this can be thought of running Orchestration Salvos. Here we can see the config for the C panel. The C panel is associated with Aux 911 is referred to seat 1 in Pro Guard. The D panel is seat 2. Here you can manually assign the 7N ProGuard units to specific panels. This also means that you can adjust the controllable panel as desired. The distinction between IP/1 and IP/2 is Seat 1/2. You will not need to work here often. Here you can see the setup for 911 Seat 2. Same IPs but Seat 2. Just because it is Seat 1 and 2, does not mean the IP will be different. The designation is made by the seat assignment on the right. Over time, this guide will be updated as we add more info with 921 and beyond.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
