(HK-PSU04)  The power supply unit of MVS-8000X is HK-PSU05. HK-PSU05 is a newly designed 1 RU size power supply unit, and the power cunsumption is equal to HK-PSU04(750W).  The power consumptions of MVS-8000X is as follows: Approximately 1200W  The secondary power supply system is structured to supply the single voltage of +12V and generate a voltage necessary for each board. Therefore, it is not required to regulate the voltage due to a difference in the numbers of the boards. MVS-8000X series 5/1/2012 Redundant Power Supply Structure  The redundant structure for MVS-8000X is 3+1.  MVS-8000X operate normally when the following number of power supply units are turned ON:  3 or more NOTE: Make sure to operate the MVS unit with all mounted power supply units turned ON. Also, if a power supply unit is OFF at the power-on operation, the corresponding LED may be temporarily lighted up in red. However, it does not indicate a fault in the unit. MVS-8000X series 5/1/2012 NOTES  As well as MVS-8000G, the pin type of connectors are mounted on the mother board. Therefore, the pins on the mother board may be bent if the mother board is installed on or removed from the chassis in the condition that the housing of a connector on a front card board or a rear connector board is damaged or deformed. The pins on the mother board are delicate and broken easily at repairing if bent. In that case, it is required to replace the mother board. Therefore, make sure to check the housings of connectors for no damage such as a deformation before mounting the mother board.  If a FAN assy stops, the temperature of the card board will rise, possibly resulting in a malfunction or a fault of an IC (FPGA). Therefore, make sure to perform the maintenance of the FAN assys regularly, such as cleaning.
