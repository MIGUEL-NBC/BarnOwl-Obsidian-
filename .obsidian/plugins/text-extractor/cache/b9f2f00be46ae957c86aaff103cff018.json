Control Panel Main Hardware Components Control Panel Modular in design, the X-series control panel offers a range of configuration and installation options. The panel is configured-to-order to best accommodate specific environments and customer preferences. Panel components, once selected, can be installed into a traditional “tub” for a flat layout typical of traditional switcher panels or, each ME row is available separately to provide a flexible installation in a curved or offset configuration. Each ME row has it’s own IP connection to the System Control Server and is powered through a PoE+ hub. DC power is also available for redundancy. This design significantly reduces noise and heat emissions from the panel and accommodates upgrades, additions and fast on-sight repairs. IP interconnectivity increases flexibility even further by enabling portions of the panel to be separated from the main “tub” for use in another part of the control room, or, in fact, anywhere within or outside the facility. This facilitates the distribution of production tasks in a busy control room and easily accommodates future growth. The panel introduces a new LCD button design for a fully customizable control surface. OLED source displays in high contrast black and white are easy to read in any environment and source labels can be customized with up to 16 characters. RGB button colors and LED lights on the crosspoint modules can be used for source designation. Red tally lights indicate any live source anywhere on the panel. 8 Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice.

Multi Program 2 Software & DMEs Multi Program 2 Software & DMEs Multi-Program 2 (XZS-8200) Multi-stream outputs are often required in many broadcast applications. Productions are always looking for faster, more efficient ways to produce different feeds from the same switcher. This could involve feeding on-set monitors with switcher content different from what is sent to air or, MP2 software enables both main program and on-set content to be switched at the same time from a single ME 3D DME (XKS-8470) The XVS-8000 switcher supports 4 channels of 3D DME in HD mode supplied via two XKS- 8470 cards. In addition to the size, position and rotation capabilities of the standard 2.5D resizer, the XKS-8470 DME option contributes additional effects capability such as: slide, squeeze, flip and tumble effects, corner pinning and enhanced lighting and border features. Also available are a wide range of “sparkle” effects such as, page turns, cylinders, ripple, broken glass, trails, sphere, kaleidoscope, sketch, draw, various “texture” effects as well as strobe and film-like effects. All DME channels on the XVS-8000 “float” and, as such, can be used with any keyer on any ME. Typical 3D DME-type effects include, adding textures, motion trails and particle effects in sports applications, it could mean creating “Home” and “Away” feeds. The Multi Program 2 software option provides a main and sub output from each ME. This includes full background transition engines and independent keying capability on both the main and sub outputs. Multi- Program 2 software essentially doubles the ME power of the production switcher transforming a 21 5ME configured switcher behave like a 10ME system. Main and Sub outputs can share keyers or be keyed independently. Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice. Color Correction Color Correction To harmonize incoming signals and correct AUX outputs for on-set monitors, venue displays and other destinations, Proc Amp, Primary and RGB color correction capabilities are available for both inputs and outputs on the XVS-8000. Output CCR for any primary or AUX output is provided as a standard feature with the XVS-8000 processor. The XKS-S8111 SDI input cards provide CCR on every input in lieu of format conversion. Color correction adjustments include: Black, White, Gamma and Knee and independent Red, Green and Blue channels on both darks and whites. The values of input color correction can be saved to Setup files while output color correction adjustments are saved as snapshot files. A CCR Aux Bus Link feature provides copy and link functions for duplicating and/or locking CCR values between multiple AUX channels for fast setup and modification. RGB color correction offers parameters to modify Red, Green and Blue color channels independently Sample of the AUX bus CCR menu. 22 Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice. Flex ME Cards Flex ME Cards The XVS-8000 ME cards are extremely flexible. When operating in HD mode, card resources can be re-set logically in the setup software to accommodate different requirements in the control room. For example, a 4ME XVS-8000 switcher with 8 keyers/ME can easily be reconfigured to become 2 x 4ME switchers with 4 keyers per ME*. The ability to allocate ME card resources in this manner greatly increases the switcher’s flexibility making it primed for virtually any production scenario. 23 4 ME cards ME 1 w/ 4 keyers ME 2 w/ 4 keyers ME 3 w/ 4 keyers P/P w/ 4 keyers ME 1 w/ 4 keyers ME 2 w/ 4 keyers ME 3 w/ 4 keyers P/P w/ 4 keyers ME 1 w/ 8 keyers ME 2 w/ 8 keyers ME 3 w/ 8 keyers P/P w/ 8 keyers 4 ME cards * Diagrams have been simplified for clarity Alternately, an XVS8000 with 5 ME cards could be re-configured as below* 5 ME cards ME 1 & 2 w/ 8 keyers ME 3 w/ 8 keyers ME 4 w/ 8 keyers P/P w/ 8 keyers ME 1 w/ 4 keyers ME 2 w/ 4 keyers ME 3 w/ 8 keyers P/P w/ 8 keyers 5 ME cards ME 1 w/ 8 keyers P/P w/ 8 keyers Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice. 4K 4K The XVS-switcher series has been developed with a 4K future in mind. The ME architecture has been designed to process 4K signals so that the ME count for the switcher processor remains the same whether operating in HD, 3G or 4K. Inputs have also been increased to support a greater number of inputs and outputs and internal format converters facilitate intermixing of 4K, 3G and HD signals as well as providing the opportunity to produce multi- format productions from a single processor. As manufacturers develop different 4K products, the XVS format converters will also simplify control room operations by supporting smooth cross convert operations between 2SI and SQD and Level A and Level B formats. 4K mode is available on the XVS-8000 switcher via a simple software upgrade using models XZS-8510 through 8550. These software licenses will provide 4K operability to each ME respectively. 4K Resources If the XVS-8000 is configured with up to 5 x XKS-8210 ME cards, 5ME operations remain available in 4K operations. The following resources are available in 4K: • 1 – 5 ME • Up to 40 inputs and 16 outputs – quad SDI or IP • 4 keyers per ME: • 2 full keyers / ME include chroma, luma, linear, pattern and colour vector keying • Full keyers have 2.5D resizers for size, position and X or Y rotation • 2 sub-keyers / ME with luma and linear keying • 1380 4K frame internal media storage for stills and animations with 5 outputs • Aux Mix Transitions Not Currently Available in 4K: • MP2 • 3D DME 24 Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice. 4K 4K 2SI and SQD Operations The XVS-8000 System Format supports 4K in both 2SI, level-A and SQD level-A natively. Level-B formats can be accommodated via the format converters on the XKS-S8111 card or the internal XKS-8460 card. We recommend operating in 2SI mode in order to fully realize the switcher’s resources. Operating in SQD Level-A natively will result in the following operational restrictions: • Only standard and enhanced wipe patterns available • Only 4 screen layout available in Multi Viewer • 2.5D resizers are not available • No grid on output signals 25 Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice. IP Sony IP Interfaces – Ready for Today, Open for Tomorrow The growth in popularity of high bandwidth video formats such as 1080P, 4K, HDR and HFR has acted as a catalyst for the development of new ways to transmit video signals. Though SDI via traditional BNC cable is both cost effective and reliable, increasing cable count to accommodate higher resolutions is not a practical long term solution. IP SONY Net Media Interface Sony’s Net Media Interface (NMI) is a core IP technology utilizing the Sony LLVC (Low Latency Video Codec) which has proven robust and effective in many broadcast environments. The Sony LLVC is particularly viable for data-heavy signals such as 4K which are lightly compressed so that they can be transmitted via a single 10GBE pipeline. At the same time, LLVC provides efficiencies to other signal formats such as 3G and HD enabling multiple signals and signal types to be transmitted via a single GBE or 10GBE interface. Sony NMI also supports uncompressed signals. Sony has developed strategies with the IP Live System Manger software to maintain signal integrity by providing redundancies, clean switching, synchronization and dynamic Quality of Service (QoS) ensuring signals get to their destinations intact and in time. NMI interfaces are being developed as standard or optional components in many Sony products including the XVS switcher series, studio camera chains, servers etc. Sony’s NMI is an open format and there are currently more than 45 solution partners working with the NMI technology. Sony has developed new technologies to establish an approach to video over IP that not only alleviates the burdens of increased BNC cabling but also introduces functional advantages to the broadcast infrastructure as a whole. Sony’s philosophy has been to work in collaboration with standards organizations while keeping the technology open to other vendors for efficient interoperability. The XVS-8000 fully embraces Sony’s IP initiatives while remaining open to other emerging future technologies. 26 Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice. IP IP As well as accommodating Sony NMI interfaces, the XVS-series switcher is also open to other IP formats through I/O cards with QSFP+ interfaces designed to be flexible and accommodate changing market demands. The XKS-Q8111 Input card and XKS-Q8166 Output card are both built with on-board Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) facilitating in-the-field updates to accommodate changing IP format requirements. Please see your Sony account rep or regional SSE for specific planned features for this input card. IP Switcher Architecture As well as supporting video signals over IP, the XVS-series switchers also embraces internal networked connections. The X-series control panel interconnects through a PoE+ (Power over Ethernet) switch and communicates to other switcher components over network connections. This not only simplifies installation but also facilitates resources sharing models by which switcher resources from disparate control rooms (within or outside a facility) can be utilized by a single operator. This would enable, for example, an XVS switcher in one location to tap into and “borrow” the ME resources from another XVS switcher in another location. This architectural approach presents opportunities for any number of control room efficiencies and cost savings. 27 Sony’s IP strategy envisions increased efficiencies and cost reductions through remote broadcast models Information in this Guide is subject to change without notice.
