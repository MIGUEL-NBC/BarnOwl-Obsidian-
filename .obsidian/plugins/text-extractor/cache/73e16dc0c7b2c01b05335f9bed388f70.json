Intp A Intp B & Shadow HK-PSU04 Recursive & Combiner & Bkgd Mix CA-54CFA Board The CA-54CFA board performs the following signal processing. · Clock signal and timing signal that are synchronized with the reference signal are generated and sent to the respective circuit boards. · Control LAN and the Data LAN communication · RS-422 communication · GPI input/output · Application software control and data management · Control over the entire system The CA-54CFA board consists of the following circuit boards. · CA-54CFA board itself · SG-272 board · DIF-130 board · SIO-25EF board · Main CPU module · CPU module for Control LAN · CPU module for Data LAN The CA-54CFA board contains the three CPU modules. The first CPU module is the main CPU module that controls the entire system and controls GPI input and output. The other two modules are the CPU modules for communication that are in charge of the Control LAN and the Data LAN respectively. For the RS-422 communications, the CPU modules for communication are in charge of two ports each. The entire system is controlled through the local CPUs and the dual port memories that are installed in the each board (the DVP-24A board, the VIF-28 board and others). The CA-54CFA board itself accepts the above-described child boards and modules on it, and outputs the various information (such as FAN ERR signal, power information, reference signal information and communication-related information) to outside as the indicator displays or the output data. The CA-54CFA board supports the Ethernet and the RS-422 communications. Various settings such as ID (IP address and others) are set using the DIP switches on the CA-54CFA board. The power supply voltages of 12 V and 3.3 V are supplied to each block. The SG-272 board is installed on the CA-54CFA board, and generates the horizontal sync pulse (HD), vertical sync pulse (VD), field information (FD), register load pulse (CKX), clock signal (HCLK) and analog reference signals that are synchronized with the external reference signals. PLD (IC113) that controls the SG-272 board, is automatically programmed by the PROM (IC302) when the power is turned on. The PLD is controlled by the main CPU that rewrites the PLD register through the local bus so that the reference signal phase and the output signal phase can be changed. The SG-272 board supports both HD (1080i system) and SD (525/625) signal formats. Status of the reference signal can be checked through the LEDs on the SG-272 board and the indicator on the CA-54CFA board. The SG-272 board receives the 12 V power from the CA-54CFA board and generates the 5 V, 3.3 V, and 1.8 V powers. The DIF-130 board is installed on the CA-54CFA board. The DIF-130 board has the function of interfacing and controlling the compact flash card that is installed in the DIF-130 board. The compact flash card that is installed in this board contains the MVE system program and the configuration data for the FPGAs installed on each circuit board. The DIF-130 board is controlled by the COM CPU_2 on the CA-54CFA board through the PCI bus. Interface and control between the PCI bus and the compact flash card are performed by the controller (IC1) on the DIF-130 board. The DIF-130 board has the two sockets for compact flash card: socket A and socket B. The socket A contains the compact flash card in which all of the data that are required to start up the MVE system are saved. The socket B is the spare socket used for data copying and others. The 3.3 V power is supplied from the CA-54CFA board. The SIO-25EF board is installed on the CA-54CFA board, and performs the RS-422 data communication using the four-channel SIO controller (IC102,111,118,126). The SIO performs the data exchange with the main CPU through the dual port RAM (IC101,110,117,125) to convert between parallel and serial data. 8 9 VIF-28 Block Diagram VIF-28 Board The VIF-28 board is a board to input/output the HD/SD multi-video format for the MVE-9000. This board consists of the control block, signal processing block, and serial digital input/output block. In the control block, the sub CPU receives the commands from the main CPU (on the CA-54CFA board) through the dual port RAM (IC3401), and controls the signal processing block through the BOOT_PLD (IC3301). The signal processing block is controlled through the FPGA_IF (IC3601). The sub CPU starts up by the 1st boot of its flash memory, then has the applications started up by the 2nd boot of the booting flash memory (IC3501) on the VIF-28 board. The BOOT_ PLD (IC3301) performs configuration of the signal processing block (FPGA: IC1 to 3) which is under the control of the sub CPU. For the configuration, the address decode to the peripheral devices of the sub CPU and the data stored in the configuration flash memory (IC3502, 3503) are used. Configuration data and the applications stored in the flash memory are rewritten on every startup when the corresponding data in the compact flash card of the main CPU has been updated. The signal processing block consists of the five FPGAs: Input XPTs (IN_FPGA (V), IN_FPGA (K), and IN_FPGA (E)) and Mixers (VMIXA and VMIXB). Each FPGA has the following main functions. (1) IN_FPGA(V) (IC1) · 4CH Video Input/Reentry Crosspoint · Input Rough TBC (2) IN_FPGA(K) (IC2) · 4CH Key Input/Reentry Crosspoint · Input Rough TBC (3) IN_FPGA(E) (IC3) · 4CH External Video Input Crosspoint · Input Rough TBC (4) VMIX_A (IC4), VMIX_B (IC5) · Combine · Recursive Effect · Background Mix · Shadow Mix · Mask Process · Graphics Insertion · DME Monitor Select · Output Proc.

The decoded Video/Key/External video signals are input into the IN_FPGAs (V/K/E) respectively, are synchronized with the internal clocks, and are then output to the C/L TRANS (CH-Link Transmitter). The Video/Key/External video signals of each channel are sent to each DVP-24A board of the corresponding channel through the MB-1000 board. The signals returned from each DVP-24A board are decoded in the C/L REC (CH-Link Receiver), and the Video/Key/External video/Z/PZ/Graphic signals for CH1 and CH2 are input in the VMIX_A (IC4) and those signals for CH3 and CH4 are input in the VMIX_B (IC5). The VMIX_A and VMIX_B are connected through the bi-directional data bus to mix the signals of CH1 and CH2, and CH3 and CH4. Also, the VMIX_A and VMIX_B have one SRAM (IC4901, 4902) and four SDRAMs (IC5001, 5002, 5101, 5102, 5201, 5301, 5202, and 5302) each, which are used for the effect processing. The Z/PZ signal is used for the combine processing in the VMIXs, where the graphic signal generated on each DVP-24A is also mixed with the video signal. The Video/Key/Monitor signals of CH1 and CH2, and those signals of CH3 and CH4 are respectively output from the VMIX_A and VMIX_B to the P/S (Serializer) through the output processing of each FPGA. These signals are converted into the SDI signals, and are output to the CN-2355A/2355B/2355C or CN-2357A/2357B. 10 Note ○ DME Wipe is not available with SDI I/O(MKE-9021M) ○ What is Shaped/Unshaped Video? A signal processed by Key is called “Shaped Video”. When MKE-9021M is used, if input video is processed by Key, set Shaped Video of input into the menu (Page 4162). In the same way if you need to use output processed by key, set Shaped Video of output. When a signal is not processed by Key, set Unshaped Video. The purpose is to keep Key edge quality . When the setup of Shaped or Unshaped is not suitable, edge quality of video processed by Key in reduced. This is because of double Keys. 11 Trouble Shooting (1/4) When MVE-9000 doesn't work but its picture is normal, < Is communication OK ? > -Check the version. -Does the menu parameter work ? If it doesn't work, communication is NG. Check the status of ‘Auto Config’ in setup menu. ・7seg.LEDs ・‘Comm LED’ (D normal light) ・Reference. If it works, communication is OK. Confirm whether you are watching the correct CH . 12 Trouble Shooting (2/4) When MVE-9000 doesn't work and its picture is abnormal, < Is MVE Processor OK ? > -Check the version, format, power supply and reference. -Do the 7seg. LEDs on each board work correctly ? If it doesn't work correctly, write down the status of 7seg. LEDs and reconfirm after resetting. (Let us know the details on 7seg.LEDs) When it reappeared on specific board, its board is NG. (However, it sometimes becomes NG for other reasons in the case of CA-54 baord. ) 13 Trouble Shooting (3/4) < Which board is bad ? > -Check the DVP-24 board. Exchange the bad board for another board and confirm which has a symptom. If there is a board which has a symptom, that board is NG. If DVP-24 board doesn’t have a symptom, VIF-28 and MKE-9020 (or 9021) may have a problem. When Monitor OUT is OK, MKE-9021M or 9020M may have a problem. When MKE-9021M is used, exchange CN-2355 which is NG for another CN-2355. ExtV/MoniOUT board is also a CN-2355 and may be used for the exchange. If there is a board which has a symptom, that board is NG. When Monitor OUT is NG, VIF-28 is doubtful. 14 Trouble Shooting (4/4) < Is MVS Processor OK ? > -Is there a board which has a LED with red lighting ? -Check the MVS-MVE interface When MKE-9021M(SDI) is used change the connection of IN/OUT. When MKE-9020M(MVS dedicated I/F) is used connect the cable with MVS (loop back) as follows. 1-2 ←→ 3-4 In such a case, the relations of input and output are as follows. 1→3, 3→1, 2→4, 4→2 If a picture is NG with this connection, MVS is NG. DIF-**** board (MVE I/F) may be the problem. 15 MVE-9000 DVP-24A Board 16 17 DME Board of MVE-9000 DVP-24A applies all 1CH DME process to Video Signal Same Hardware as BKDS-9470 BKDS-9470: DVP-24 MVE-9000: DVP-24A Replace FPGA Configuration Data and Boot Software Multi-Format Some Functions move to VIF-28 board  Combine  Recursive / Shadow Mix (after Combine Process)  Background Mix  Graphic Insertion  Monitor Selector FPGA Solution Able to revise function by Software upgrade Twin SUB CPU for Effect Control Feature 18 Board to Board Channel-Link  Receiver : THC63LVDF84  Transmitter : THC63LVDM83 Interface with VIF-28 and Polygon board FPGA to FPGA Source Synchronous Interface  Transmit with clock  High speed and no error interface: 400Mbps/1pair  Adjust clock phase whenever booting up Video Signal Interface 19 Layout PVM MIX FILTER INTPA INTPB ADRS DCDC +1.5V-1 DCDC +2.5V-1 DCDC +1.5V-2 DCDC +2.5V-2 DCDC +3.3V SUB CPU B FPGA IF BOOT PLD SUB CPU A DVP-24 1-685-679-13 DVP-24A Board In contrast to the DVP-24 board for BKDS-9470, the DVP-24A board supports the multi-format and performs the SD signal processing for only one channel. Some functions such as combine processing are performed on the VIF-28 board. The DVP-24A board consists of the control block and the signal processing block. The control block consists of the sub CPUs A and B. Both sub CPUs receive the commands from the main CPU (on the CA-54CFA board) through dual port RAM (IC3801,3909), and control the signal processing blocks through BOOT_PLD (IC108). The FPGAs of both of the sub CPU A and the sub CPU B are controlled via FPGA_IF (IC107). The sub CPU A mainly performs the non-linear and background processings, and the sub CPU B performs the other processing. The respective sub CPUs start up by the 1st boot of its flash memory, then have the applications started up by the 2nd boot of the booting flash memory (IC4001,4002) on the DVP-24A board. The BOOT_PLD (IC108) performs configuration of the other FPGAs on the DVP-24A board using the address decode to the peripheral devices of the sub CPU and using the configuration data that is stored in the configuration flash memory under the control of the sub CPU A. The configuration data and the applications that are stored in flash memory are newly rewritten when the installation work is done by the compact flash card of the main CPU. The signal processing block consists of the six FPGAs: Pre Video Modify (PVM), Filter (FLTR), Address Generator (ADRS), Interpolator A (INTPA), Interpolator B (INTPB) and Mixer (MIX). The abbreviated names shown in parentheses ( ) are used for description below. The respective FPGAs have the following main functions. (1) PVM (IC101) · Input TBC · Border/Crop/Beveled Edge · Video Modify (Posterization, Solarization, Mosaic and other) · Input Freeze (2) FLTR (IC102) · Antialias Filter (Horizontal and vertical directions) · Scan Conversion · Field/Frame Conversion · Defocus/Blur (3) ADRS (IC106) · 3D Linear Transform · Non-linear (4) INTPA/B (IC103,104) · Interpolation · Lighting (5) MIX (IC105) · Recursive · Graphics (Generate Only) 20 Video Signal Flow CL DEC PVM (FPGA) DDR SDRAM FILTER (FPGA) INTP A/B (FPGA) MIX (FPGA) CL ENC ADRS (FPGA) ZBT SRAM DDR SDRAM DDR SDRAM ZBT SRAM ZBT SRAM ZBT SRAM from VIF-28 for VIF-28 Y C K EXTV Y C K Z AUX 20 Video Signal Flow CL DEC PVM (FPGA) DDR SDRAM FILTER (FPGA) INTP A/B (FPGA) MIX (FPGA) CL ENC ADRS (FPGA) ZBT SRAM DDR SDRAM DDR SDRAM ZBT SRAM ZBT SRAM ZBT SRAM from VIF-28 for VIF-28 Y C K EXTV Y C K Z AUX The signal flows are as follows: The video, key, and external video signals from the VIF-28 board are received by the LVDS receivers (IC701,702,703). Then, these signals are sent to PVM (IC101). In PVM (IC101), these signals receive the signal processing such as Input TBC, Input Freeze using the DDR SDRAM (IC1401,1402), Video Modify, Border/Crop/Beveled Edge, and then the Video/Key signals are sent to FLTR (IC102). In FLTR (IC102), these signals receive the filtering processing (antialias filter) in accordance with the Defocus/Blur in the horizontal direction and with the compression ratio. After that, these signals receive re-arrangement (Scan Conversion) using the DDR SDRAM (IC1901,1902) and also receive Defocus/Blur in the vertical direction and the antialias filtering processing. These signals then receive the Field/Frame Conversion using the DDR SDRAM (IC2101,2102,2201). The output data are sent to INTPA/B (IC103,104), where they are stored in ZBT SRAM. In INTPA/B (IC103,104), data is read from ZBT SRAM according to the address generated by ADRS, and the interpolation processing is performed. In INTPB (IC104), the Video/Key signals receive the lighting processing, and are then sent to MIX (IC105). In MIX (IC105), the Recursive processing using the DDR SDRAM (IC3201,3202,3301,3302) and superimposition (Graphics) for coordinate axis display are performed so that the Video/Key signals and the Graphics data signals are sent to the VIF-28 board using the LVDS transmission via the LVDS transmitters (IC801,802,803,804). 21 FPGA Function PVM Input TBC Border/Crop/Beveled Edge Video Modify (Posterization, Solarization, Mosaic etc.) Input Freeze Mask Key Generate (since V3.0) Advanced Video Modify (Sketch, Metal, etc.) FILTER Antialias Filter (horizontal and vertical) Scan Conversion Field/Frame Conversion Defocus/Blur Mask process 22 ADRS 3D Linear Transform Non-linear Spot Lighting Key Generate (since V3.0) INTP_A/B Interpolation Lighting ArtEdge (since V3.0) FlexShadow Key Generate (since V3.0) MIX Recursive (Trail, MotionDecay, KeyframeStrobe, since V3.0) FlexShadow Mix (since V3.0) Dim and Fade (since V3.0) Spot Lighting Mix (since V3.0) Graphics ( Generate Only ) 23 Control System DP RAM SUB CPU A SUB CPU B FPGA IF (FPGA) BOOT PLD FLASH from CA-54 Addr Data CTLs COM A/B Reset EEPROM DP RAM BUF BUF FLASH BUF & DRV BUF & DRV SWs, LEDs SWs, LEDs BUF Configuration Data for FPGAs Read and Write FPGA Registers for Effect Control COM A/B Reset USB EEPROM FLASH FLASH FLASH Boot Boot FPGA Config.
