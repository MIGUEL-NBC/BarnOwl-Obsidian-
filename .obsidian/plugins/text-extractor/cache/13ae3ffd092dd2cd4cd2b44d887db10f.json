35-mm type CMOS sensor array with a total of 20 Megapixels. The camera is incorporated with newly developed imagers and a digital signal-processing LSI that yield images of a high quality for cinematic, commercial, and dramatic production applications. The camera also supports the features of a “production camera” up to details in its shape, button and indicator layout, and materials of the parts. Superior picture quality and high performance Super 35-mm type CMOS and PL mount With the F65’s Super 35-mm-type CMOS imagers and PL mount, most movie lenses designed for conventional 35- mm film cameras can be mounted without a converter. Wide latitude and high-quality pictures With its newly developed imagers, and unique 16-bit digital LSI, the camera achieves wide latitude and high- grade picture quality with minimal noise. RAW image output Outputs RAW image data, without camera signal processing or non-linear gamma processing, for increased convenience during post-production. Multiple frame formats The camera supports 3840/4096-pixel wide images for high-end content creation, including commercial and broadcasting program production as well as movie making. The camera supports the following formats. F65RAW mode: 23.98p, 24p, 25p, 29.97p, 59.94p, S59.94p (Select FPS), S60p (Select FPS) HD mode: 23.98p, 25p, 29.97p Imaging characteristics with wide color space Sony’s unique technology color filters allow the camera to capture images with natural-looking color reproduction close to those of the actual scene. S-LOG gamma and 709(800%) gamma for monitors The camera is equipped with S-LOG gamma for checking the entire dynamic range of the image, and 709(800%) gamma for general monitoring. Mechanical rotary shutter The camera is equipped with a mechanical rotary shutter that eliminates the rolling shutter effect common to conventional CMOS image sensors. HD shooting When used with the SR-R4 recorder, the camera can also shoot images in HD mode, in addition to RAW mode. SR-R4 version 1.4 or later is required to record in HD. Design and shape New compact design For a high level of mobility in consideration of various shooting situations, such as inside a car, the camera is housed in as compact a body as possible. In addition, buttons and indicators are laid out to provide a familiar and intuitive user interface to users of conventional cinema film cameras. Dockable system for the SR-R4 Portable Memory Recorder A dockable interface system for docking with the SR-R4 is employed for versatility under shooting conditions and on- site demands. Compatible with film-camera accessories The F65 is designed to be compatible with a variety of film-camera accessories, giving users a broad array of choices. These include ARRIFLEX-made bridge plates, matte boxes, follow focus units, lens focus/zoom/iris servo control units, and more. These film-camera accessories can be attached to the F65 without modification, enabling 8 Features Chapter 1 Overview users who principally work with film to fully utilize their existing assets.

Assignable buttons The F65 is equipped with assignable buttons on the side of the camera head. The operator can assign frequently used functions, such as magnifying the image in the viewfinder, to assignable buttons to call these functions rapidly when working in the field. Operational versatility Shooting mode presumes post-production processing The F65 does not perform processing of images on-site, instead you shoot in a mode that presumes images will be processed in post-production, in much the same way you would operate a film camera. Shutter control The shutter speed is adjustable in terms of shutter angle. You can also switch between a mechanical rotary shutter and an electronic shutter. Monitor output selection You can select imposition of markers in the monitor output, and also select a look-up table (LUT) for the desired tone of the monitor image. Sensitivity adjustment function The F65 employs an EI sensitivity indicator for shooting using a light meter, just as for film cameras, to enable overexposure/underexposure processing in post- production. Other features USB host connectors The camera is equipped with USB connectors (host) for connection with an optional Wi-Fi adapter (CBK-WA01) to enable wireless camera operation from a tablet or other Wi-Fi capable device. Supports various setup methods The F65 can be configured from a variety of devices. The basic configuration is performed on the camera’s subdisplay.

For details about mounting the SR-R4, refer to the Operation Manual of the SR-R4. • Always turn off the camera power supply when mounting the SR-R4. • The recorder connector for connecting the SR-R4 is an optical connector. Attach the connector cap on the optical connector when not connected to an SR-R4 to protect the connector. After removing the cap, store it in the position shown in the following figure for safekeeping. • When mounting the SR-R4, fix the camera head on a tripod in advance to keep the camera head stable. For tripod mounting, see “2-4 Mounting the Camera on a Tripod” (page 20). • When the camera is used with the SR-R4 docked, make sure that the camera is securely fixed and stable so that it will not fall over. Notes SR-R4 17Attaching a Lens Chapter 2 Installation and Preparations 2-2 Attaching a Lens Attach a lens that conforms to the PL lens mount. Always use a lens whose projection from the flange (A in the figure) is less than 31.5 mm (1 1/4 inch). Use of any lens that protrudes more than 31.5 mm (1 1/4 inch) will damage the internal filter. For information on handling lenses, refer to the operation manual for the lens. 1 Rotate the lens fixing lever counterclockwise and remove the lens mount cap from the lens mount. 2 Align the lens’ alignment pin with the notch in the upper part of the lens mount and insert the lens into the mount. 3 While supporting the lens, rotate the lens fixing lever clockwise to secure the lens. Changing the position of the lens fixing lever Remove the four screws from the face of the lens fixing lever indicated in the figure. Change the position of the fixing lever, reinsert the screws and securely tighten. Adjusting the flange focal length The optical section uses materials not susceptible to thermal expansion, so flange back adjustment is generally not required. However, if you want to make an adjustment, remove the lens mount and replace the shim with one of the appropriate thickness. At shipment, a 0.05 mm (0.0020 inch) shim is installed. The following replacement shims are available. For information about replacing shims, consult your local Sony representative.

Wrap excess cable length around the cable holder. 2-6 Preparing the Power Supply This camera operates at 12 V DC (10.5 V to 17 V). To supply power to the camera, attach the supplied 8-pin power cable connector to a commercially available shielded cable, and then connect the cable to the DC IN connector (LEMO 8-pin) on the camera. For details on connector pin assignments, see “Connector Pin Assignments” (page 57) in the Appendix. For details on the pin connections, consult your local Sony representative. • Use of a power supply with 150 W or higher supply capacity is recommended to safely drive the camera. The specifications for the power supply cable should be chosen such that the voltage drop is less than 2 V. Example: If a 5-meter (16 ft 5 in.) AWG 18 × 3 cable is used to supply the camera and SR-R4, the voltage drop will be 0.5 to 1.0 V. • If using the camera’s 24 V DC output to drive peripherals, 12 V DC and 24 V DC power supplies must be connected to the camera via the DC IN connector (LEMO 8-pin) of the power cable (supplied). • When using the SR-R4 docked on the camera, the connection of a 13 V to 17 V DC power source is recommended. To turn on the camera Set the CAM POWER switch to the ON position, and the camera is turned on. Power is also supplied to viewfinder connected to the VF connector. 12 V or 24 V power can be fed to accessories via the DC OUT connectors. To supply 24 V power to accessories, 12 V and 24 V DC input power supplies must be connected via the DC IN connector of the camera. For the pin assignment for the 24 V power supply DC IN connector, see “Connector Pin Assignments” (page 57) in the Appendix.

When shooting, the camera gain is fixed and the sensitivity is set using a light meter. The base sensitivity is 800EI, and can be adjusted over a range of ± 2 stops in 1/3 stop increments. When the sensitivity is set to a value higher than the base 800EI, the main camera output signal becomes darker. However, the gain of the images in the viewfinder and on the monitor connected to the SDI OUT connector are automatically adjusted in response to the sensitivity setting to provide appropriate monitoring capability while shooting. The full latitude does not change when the sensitivity setting is changed, but the dynamic range and noise floor changes in post-production with suitable processing. When the sensitivity is set high, the dynamic range increases on one hand, while the noise in dark areas also increases. Conversely, when the sensitivity is set low, the dynamic range decreases but the noise in the dark areas also decreases. The white balance can be set to 3200K (tungsten), 4300K (tungsten), or 5500K (daylight). The camera supports HD mode recording, where images are down-converted to HD internally and recorded on the SR-R4.

Indicator Subdisplay Self diagnostics field indication Meaning 52 Precautions Appendix Precautions Use and storage Do not subject the unit to severe shocks The internal mechanism may be damaged or the body warped. Do not block the ventilation holes If the ventilation holes are blocked, not only are the characteristics not guaranteed, but also extreme degradation of the internal parts will likely result, causing defects of the camera. For the locations of the ventilation holes, see the figures in “1-3 Locations and Functions of Parts” (page 11). After use Always turn off the power. Use and storage locations Store in a level, ventilated place. Avoid using or storing the unit in the following places: • Places subject to temperature extremes • Very damp places • Places subject to severe vibration • Near strong magnetic fields • In direct sunlight or close to heaters for extended periods To prevent electromagnetic interference from portable communications devices The use of portable telephones and other communications devices near this unit can result in malfunctions and interference with audio and video signals. It is recommended that the portable communications devices near this unit be powered off. Note on laser beams Laser beams may damage the image sensor device. If you shoot a scene that includes a laser beam, be careful not to let the laser beam be directed into the lens of the camera. Condensation If you move the camera from a very cold place to a warm place, or use it in a damp location, condensation may form on the lens or inside the camera. The camera has no built-in condensation indicator. If you find condensation on the body or lens, switch the camera off and wait for the condensation to disappear for about one hour. Image sensor phenomena The following phenomena that may appear in images are specific to image sensors. They do not indicate malfunctions. White flecks Although the image sensors are produced with high- precision technologies, fine white flecks may be generated on the screen in rare cases, caused by cosmic rays. This is related to the principle of image sensors and is not a malfunction. The white flecks especially tend to be seen • when operating at a high environmental temperature Aliasing When fine patterns, stripes, or lines are shot, they may appear jagged or flicker. To forcibly open the shutter Should the shutter to control incoming light to the image sensor not open, immediately consult your local Sony representative. If you want to continue shooting urgently, you can use the shutter emergency open screw (page 11) to forcibly open the shutter to a position that ensures an optical light path. For information about using the shutter emergency open screw, consult your local Sony representative. When setting the video format It is recommended that the power be turned off and back on again after changing the video format. 53Cleaning the Recorder Connector / About “Memory Stick Duo” Appendix Cleaning the Recorder Connector Before cleaning the recorder connector, always check that the power supply is disconnected before proceeding.

Supported devices iPad, iPad2 iOS 5.0 or later Android devices 1) Android 3.2 1) Operation tested on Sony tablet devices only. 61Operation using a Tablet Device Appendix Camera and Tablet Device Connections There are two modes supported for connecting devices. Infrastructure mode Uses a Wi-Fi connection between the camera and table device via a wireless LAN access point. In this mode, multiple devices can communicate with the camera wirelessly via the access point. Use this mode if you plan to connect with and control a camera from more than one tablet device. Ad-hoc mode Uses a direct Wi-Fi connection between the camera and table device. In this mode, an access point is not required, and only a single device can communicate with the camera wirelessly. Use this mode if an access point cannot be set up due to difficulty guaranteeing the power supply or other reasons. For details about the connection method, refer to the help for the tablet device. • Connection using IEEE802.11n is not supported in ad- hoc mode. Data encryption method uses WEP only. • Some tablet devices are not equipped with the necessary hardware for ad-hoc mode. For details, refer to the operating instructions for your tablet device. • While multiple tablet devices can connect to the camera in infrastructure mode, only the device that is “Active” may modify the camera settings. Other connected devices may only monitor the settings. • If the camera is connected using a network cable and the IP address settings on the <LAN Setting> page and the <Wi-Fi Setting> page in the Network menu are the same, then Wi-Fi is disabled. To use LAN and Wi-Fi simultaneously, set different values for the IP address settings on the <LAN Setting> page and the <Wi-Fi Setting> page. If the camera is not connected using a network cable, then Wi-Fi is enabled, even if the same IP address is set on both pages. iPad is a trademark of Apple Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

The color space of the output signal for the viewfinder and SDI OUT connectors is converted to ITU-R BT.709 color space. Colorimetry 1. Virtual chromaticity points at S-GAMUT The virtual color space at S-GAMUT is shown in the above chart. The virtual chromaticity points are as follows: When converting the color space of a video source shot with this camera in S-GAMUT mode, use these virtual chromaticity points. These chromaticity points are “virtual” because they do not represent the actual, accurate color space but are the calculated values for calculation of color space conversion. These virtual chromaticity points have been introduced because the actual color space cannot be represented as a triangle in this colorimetry. The following equation provides a simple conversion from the color space for S-GAMUT to that for conventional cameras (HDC-F950, HDW-F900R, etc.): (Rw, Gw, Bw): RGB values for the original color space for S-GAMUT (R, G, B): Values after being converted to the color space for conventional cameras Use the following equations to convert from S-GAMUT to another color gamut.

The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software-to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation’s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author’s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors’ reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone’s free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. 65Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The “Program”, below, refers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program” means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) Each licensee is addressed as “you”. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 66 Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. 67Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms. To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. One line to give the program’s name and a brief idea of what it does. Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. 68 Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode: Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘show w’. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type ‘show c’ for details. The hypothetical commands ‘show w’ and ‘show c’ should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than ‘show w’ and ‘show c’; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names: Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program ‘Gnomovision’ (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker. signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License. GNU Lesser General Public License Version 2.1, February 1999 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software packages-typically libraries- -of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things. 69Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author’s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others. Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs. When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library. We call this license the “Lesser” General Public License because it does Less to protect the user’s freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances. For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a defacto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system. Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users’ freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a “work based on the library” and a “work that uses the library”. The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run. TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called “this License”). Each licensee is addressed as “you”. 70 Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix A “library” means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The “Library”, below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A “work based on the Library” means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term “modification”.) “Source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library’s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. 71Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a “work that uses the Library”. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a “work that uses the Library” with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a “work that uses the library”. The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a “work that uses the Library” uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a “work that uses the Library” with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer’s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work 72 Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable “work that uses the Library”, as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user’s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the “work that uses the Library” must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients’ exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the 73Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any later version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 74 Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

This product includes software openssh to which the license below applies. Please note that we cannot respond to inquiries regarding the content of the source code. The licences which components of this software fall under are as follows. First, we will summarize and say that all components are under a BSD licence, or a licence more free than that. OpenSSH contains no GPL code. 1) Copyright (c) 1995 Tatu Ylonen <ylo@cs.hut.fi>, Espoo, Finland All rights reserved As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software can be used freely for any purpose. Any derived versions of this software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be called by a name other than “ssh” or “Secure Shell” . [Tatu continues] However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that are not under my direct control. As far as I know, all included source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most restrictive); see below for details. [However, none of that term is relevant at this point in time. All of these restrictively licenced software components which he talks about have been removed from OpenSSH, i.e., - RSA is no longer included, found in the OpenSSL library - IDEA is no longer included, its use is deprecated - DES is now external, in the OpenSSL library - GMP is no longer used, and instead we call BN code from OpenSSL - Zlib is now external, in a library - The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included - TSS has been removed - MD5 is now external, in the OpenSSL library - RC4 support has been replaced with ARC4 support from OpenSSL - Blowfish is now external, in the OpenSSL library [The licence continues] Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide. More information can be found e.g. at “http:// www.cs.hut.fi/crypto”. The legal status of this program is some combination of all these permissions and restrictions. Use only at your own responsibility. You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” 79Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 2) The 32-bit CRC compensation attack detector in deattack.c was contributed by CORE SDI S.A. under a BSD-style license.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license.

As a consequence, its main points are that: • We don’t promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. (‘as is’ distribution) • You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. (‘royalty-free’ usage) • You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. (‘credits’) We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project. Finally, many people asked us for a preferred form for a credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license. We thus encourage you to use the following text: Portions of this software are copyright (C) <year> The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved. Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you actually use. Legal Terms 0. Definitions Throughout this license, the terms ‘package’, ‘FreeType Project’, and ‘FreeType archive’ refer to the set of files originally distributed by the authors (David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg) as the ‘FreeType Project’, be they named as alpha, beta or final release. ‘You’ refers to the licensee, or person using the project, where ‘using’ is a generic term including compiling the project’s source code as well as linking it to form a ‘program’ or ‘executable’. This program is referred to as ‘a program using the FreeType engine’. This license applies to all files distributed in the original FreeType Project, including all source code, binaries and documentation, unless otherwise stated in the file in its original, unmodified form as distributed in the original archive. If you are unsure whether or not a particular file is covered by this license, you must contact us to verify this. 88 Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix The FreeType Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000 by David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg. All rights reserved except as specified below. 1. No Warranty THE FREETYPE PROJECT IS PROVIDED ‘AS IS’ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT. 2. Redistribution This license grants a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, execute, perform, compile, display, copy, create derivative works of, distribute and sublicense the FreeType Project (in both source and object code forms) and derivative works thereof for any purpose; and to authorize others to exercise some or all of the rights granted herein, subject to the following conditions: • Redistribution of source code must retain this license file (‘FTL.TXT’) unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. The copyright notices of the unaltered, original files must be preserved in all copies of source files. • Redistribution in binary form must provide a disclaimer that states that the software is based in part of the work of the FreeType Team, in the distribution documentation. We also encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page in your documentation, though this isn’t mandatory. These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the FreeType Project, not just the unmodified files. If you use our work, you must acknowledge us. However, no fee need be paid to us. 3. Advertising Neither the FreeType authors and contributors nor you shall use the name of the other for commercial, advertising, or promotional purposes without specific prior written permission. We suggest, but do not require, that you use one or more of the following phrases to refer to this software in your documentation or advertising materials: ‘FreeType Project’, ‘FreeType Engine’, ‘FreeType library’, or ‘FreeType Distribution’. As you have not signed this license, you are not required to accept it. However, as the FreeType Project is copyrighted material, only this license, or another one contracted with the authors, grants you the right to use, distribute, and modify it. Therefore, by using, distributing, or modifying the FreeType Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms of this license. 4. Contacts There are two mailing lists related to FreeType: • freetype@nongnu.org Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as future and wanted additions to the library and distribution. If you are looking for support, start in this list if you haven’t found anything to help you in the documentation. • freetype-devel@nongnu.org Discusses bugs, as well as engine internals, design issues, specific licenses, porting, etc. 89Notice Concerning Software Governed by the GNU GPL/LGPL Appendix Our home page can be found at http://www.freetype.org This product includes software usagi-tool to which the license below applies.
