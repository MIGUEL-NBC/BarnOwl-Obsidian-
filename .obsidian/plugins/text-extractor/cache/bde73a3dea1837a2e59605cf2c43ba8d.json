All others added in the system will be treated as discrete aggregators Devices Used In an Audio Subsystem Company Confidential ▪ 570EMR-AG-HUB Inputs/Outputs • 20 x DIN connectors • There are 512 mono audio channels for each of the TDM inputs and Outputs • TDM Inputs are DIN 1 through 10 • TDM Outputs are DIN 11 through 20 • 2 x 10GE SFP Ports are used for AES67 which is used in SPMTE-2110 based systems • 128 multicasts for each of the TDM inputs and outputs • SFP 5 sends/receives AES67 audio for TDM Inputs 1-5 and Outputs 11-15. • SFP 7 sends/receives AES67 audio for TDM Inputs 6-10 and Outputs 16-20.

TX can be cross checked using Go Bar in SDVN. To View the Route in the Audio Subsystem Company Confidential ▪ Using the command bar at the top of Launcher enter the multicast address • i.e. 226.0.20.2 will display which device this signal is associated to and what stream (audio group) this address is associated to • In the picture below we can see that this multicast is associated to Audio Group 1 of the source name IPG-SRC-VID-1 To Verify the Signals Company Confidential ▪ The final troubleshooting step is to verify the signal path through the IP core device: • Verify that it is entering the device on the right port based on the source device and that it is being routed to the correct destination port based on the AG-HUB device it is passing though • Repeat this for the signal leaving A.Sub and going back to the core before arriving at the receive device. Viewing the Route through the IP Core Company Confidential ▪ In the magrtrsrv log file you will be able to see the route through the AG-HUB when a breakaway route is performed from Magnum-ClientHost • You can view the route set command from here and see which audio level has been routed to the desired destination Viewing the A.Sub Routes in the Log Files Company Confidential ▪ This example will shuffle a channel from SRC 2 into a channel at the destination with the remaining channels from SRC 1 Used TX to Used RX Relationship SRC 1 SRC 2 IPX AG-HUB ADMX DST 1 4 x signals 1 x signal 4 x signals ▪ This means there will be 5 RX channels used but only 4 TX channels","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
