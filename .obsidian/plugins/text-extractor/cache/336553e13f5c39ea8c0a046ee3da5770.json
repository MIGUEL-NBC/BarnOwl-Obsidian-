We completed this next round with REMs 55-128. We had one card failure (REM 81), but we swapped the ITXE Card with a spare (Thanks James) and got that running and retested with MTC. We will be continuing with a third upgrade night tomorrow evening. Please be aware of any reports and let us know if anything pops up.
