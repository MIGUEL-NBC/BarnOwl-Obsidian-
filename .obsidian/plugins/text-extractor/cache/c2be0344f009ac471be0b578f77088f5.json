{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Studio Maintenance - 30 Rock Global Infrastructure/Daylight Savings Info/Fall Time Change on 2 AND 7 .docx","text":"Time Change on the 2nd Floor Evertz 5601MSC’s        This doc will describe how to “fall back” on the 2nd floor 5601 master Sync Generators.  The purpose is to change the UTC offset of the LTC & VITC Time Of Day (TOD) outputs to match DST or EST, depending on season.    On 11/7 we will be Falling Out of DST.      Prior to the 11/7/2021 Time Change event a meeting invites for a conference call will go out to WNBC,  DPS, Studios and Satops and may be forwarded out to others to join a conf bridge that will be open during this change.  Since there is an SNL that night it is very likely that the time change will not be allowed to happen due to possible west coast fixes for SNL.  Typically, we usually wait until the west coast SNL show is over – somewhere around 3:30am.         Overview:    There are 2 redundant pairs of GPS locked Evertz reference generators in the 2nd floor equipment room ERD.  This system outputs Blackburst and Timecode that gets distributed throughout the 30 Rock plant.  A lot of these distribution end points are now being fed from a similar GPS locked system on the 7tth floor.  Nevertheless this system is still relied on for reference signals in various places and needs to be kept active and accurate for now.     The system has 3 Evertz 5601ACO (Auto Change-Over) switches who’s selection configuration determines which of the 4 generators is the one actually feeding signals out to the plant. Only one of these at a time can be “on-line”.  The ACO between the X pair of generators is in AUTO and so is the one between the Y pair of generators.  The last ACO switch is always set to MANUAL and determines if the X ACO or the Y ACO is on-line.   A look at the indicator lights on the ACO switches will reveal which side (X or Y) is active and which generator is the one on line.   Because the last switch is in manual we can tell which side cannot go on line unless we manually switch the last (3rd) ACO.  For this reason is it safe to adjust the time offsets earlier on the off-line side, or practice the settings on the off-line side.  Procedure:  When you get to the generators located in racks ERD-75 & 76 You will find that the Panel Lock lights are lit on their front panels.   To turn those lights off enabling changes to occur press SELECT and PANEL LOCK at the same time. The PANEL LOCK light should now be out.  Documentation shows that the 5601 generators make TOD on LTC out 1 and VITC out 5 but we need to verify this.  Press the \tSTATUS button and hit the ESC button a few times to get up to the top menu.  Using the knob OR the up/down arrow buttons move the “>” in the left screen to “SYNC 1-6” and press SELECT.  Move the “>” to the L1, L2 display.  L1 should show NY time and L2 should show UTC time. Now Move the “>” to the SYNC 1-6  display.  S5 should have NY time and all the others should show UTC.  Now we have confirmed we have to change the offsets on each generator’s L1 and S5 outputs.  When you do the following steps you are changing the LTC and VITC the generator is putting out Press OUTPUT, move the “>” to LTC 1, press SELECT, move the “>” to TIMEZONE and press SELECT. You should see “-4” highlighted.   Move the “>” to “-5” and press select. Press ESC twice and move the “>” to “SYNC 5” and hit SELECT.    You should see “-4” highlighted.  Move the “>” to “-5” and press select.    Make sure you do the same thing to all 4 generators.  Post Time-Change Checks Check the ERC-212 Sports Room MVP and adjust the on-screen clock offset as necessary Check the ERC-93 Old Jerrold O&O displayed times and adjust those clock offsets. Nick C and Rich Lowen know how to do this 7N Daylight Savings Department Involved: Studios Maintenance Author: Date: Andrew Mannino 10/25/2020 Objective/Purpose: This should serve as the reference for the daylight savings time work for the PTP timing system that originates in 7N. The system is based off the Evertz 5700MSC-IP and 7800SRG-IP configured in a hierarchal design which is distributed via a pair of switches referred to as IPSR. All clocks on the system participate in a BMCA (Best Master Clock Algorithm) to determine which of the 4 GPS-locked Grand Masters is leading at any given time. If one of these clocks were to fail the failover should be seamless as the BMCA is rerun and an new master takes over, if all 4 fail then one of the lower tier clocks will be elected and the system will free run as it will not be GPS-locked. No action is required on the grand masters and only items detailed on the attached table as “Auto DST = No” require intervention. It was decided that test signals will auto adjust as they are typically just for monitoring purposes and all 7N-based systems rely fully on VITC that is UTC based. LTC 1 is feeding a time code clock for sensor delay and can be adjusted manually or via VistaLinkPRO. Each “Island” refers to the distribution of PTP load from the high number of end devices across multiple master clocks and was done by both Evertz and NBC Staff so there is no hard and fast rule for which facilities point to which island. Each end device is connected to both clocks in that island for redundancy. These island boundaries also feed NTP to devices like VIPs for their on display clocks which can take several minutes after the DST update to properly reflect. DreamCatcher servers receive PCR via a private 10G network NTP from a dedicated set of boundary clocks. PTP is supplied via the EXE SDVN Network and is responsible for the output timing. All DreamCatcher servers are configured as a custom time zone which will force DST at 4a rather than 2a to not conflict with late night productions. See step 3 below for preparation.

(VistaLink) All CR’s & studio floors clocks should be checked that they have updated All CR’s local router BARS that have clocks should show correct NY time. 7N Censor Delay room clock should be correct. NOTES: Graphics Systems - They sync with the windows time, which is synchronized with Vprod.IO and nbcutime1.tfayd.com Sony ELC – No intervention needed. Entertainment Systems - All systems are bound to the time server.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
