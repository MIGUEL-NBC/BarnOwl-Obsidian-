OVERVIEW Figure 1-1: Front View of the 5700MSC-IP The 5700MSC-IP is an IP Network Grand Master Clock and a Video Master Sync Generator both referenced to GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System (GPS and/or GLONASS)). The system features 2-GbE, 2-10GbE ports, 6 fully timeable sync outputs, 4 SDI outputs, and a loop thru reference input. For those hybrid plants where LTC outputs and AES/analog audio test sets required, an optional (+AUX) expansion module is available. This combo IP Network Grand Master Clock and Master Sync Generator is ideal for timing today‟s IP based video broadcast, production, and distribution facilities. It provides all the future timing needs of an IP based plant while providing precision reference to any baseband SDI/Analog systems. The test generator option(s) provide several test sets which are available on the 4 SDI (SD/HD/3Gbps) outputs as well as over the 10GbE IP outputs (10GbE SFP‟s are optional). There are 10 independent test signal generators when a test generator option is ordered, any can be routed to the 10GbE outputs, or the SDI outputs (4 generators may be combined to form a 4K signal generator). As for IP timing formats, the 5700MSC-IP has been designed to be enterprise class, handling all current IP timing needs with the horsepower to address the future. It supports NTP, PTP-IEEE1588, MASTER PCR, AVB-IEEE802.1AS, AES67 profile and SMPTE 2059-2. IP networking for live production and broadcast environments have very specific needs and requirements that typically involve deterministic flows, high bandwidth, and an SDN based network design. The 5700MSC-IP can be used to design a robust, safe, and deterministic timing system for any IP Network or Hybrid IP/Baseband Video system. The product has been designed to handle timing requirements of several thousands of PTP clients. The 5700MSC-IP has two 10 GbE ports as well as two GbE ports that can be configured to provide and distribute any of the timing protocols described above. This 5700MSC-IP is delivered with a GNSS head capable of receiving GPS and GLONASS satellite constellation signals and complete with a 50ft cable for remote mounting. (100ft, 400ft and fiber optic extension options are available for longer cable lengths). A high stability, temperature controlled oscillator provides the 5700MSC-IP with better than 1.0x10-8 (or 0.01ppm) frequency reference. The free running drift of this 10MHz reference will be less than 0.1Hz (which amounts to less than one millisecond time drift per day). This guarantees that any frequency drift, with time and temperature, will be within the tolerances expected from the best SPGs or master clocks available in the industry. Note that the provided GNSS head capable of receiving GPS and GLONASS satellite constellation signals is required for PTP, AVB PCR, or 2059-2 timing protocols to be hosted by the system. The 5700MSC-IP can also produce PTP, AVB, PCR or 2059-2 timing protocols when using a PTP reference of suitable quality. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 1-2 Revision 0.1 OVERVIEW The SPG section of the 5700MSC-IP provides six independent timeable reference outputs. These six sync outputs may be configured to provide independently timed color black (black burst) outputs, independently timed HDTV tri-level sync outputs, 10MHz outputs, word clock, and various available pulses. It is available with a main processing board and optional redundant power supply.

CEA: Consumer Electronics Association. CEA is a professional organization that recommends standards and practices for the U.S. consumer electronics industry. CLIFF EFFECT: Also referred to as the „digital cliff‟. This is a phenomenon found in digital video systems that describes the sudden deterioration of picture quality due to excessive bit errors, often caused by excessive cable lengths. The digital signal will be perfect even though one of its signal parameters is approaching or passing the specified limits. At a given moment however, the parameter will reach a point where the data can no longer be interpreted correctly, and the picture will be totally unrecognisable. COMPONENT ANALOG: The non-encoded output of a camera, video tape recorder, etc., consisting of the three primary colour signals: red, green, and blue (RGB) that together convey all necessary picture information.

In each case, the actual measurement is compared to a fixed reference level r and the \"decibel\" value is defined to be 10 log10(a/r). Many units of this kind have been used and only a few of the more common ones are mentioned in the next entries. In each case the dB symbol is followed by a second symbol identifying the specific measurement. Often the two symbols are not separated (as in \"dBA\"), but the Audio Engineering Society recommends that a space be used (as in \"dB A\"). dB FS: Abbreviation for \"decibels full scale,\" a unit of power as measured by a digital device. A digital measurement has a maximum value M depending on the number of bits used. If the actual power measurement is p, the dB FS value displayed is 20·log10(p/M) dB FS. Since p cannot exceed M, this reading is always negative. dBm, dBW: Logarithmic units of power used in electronics. These units measure power in decibels above the reference level of 1 milliwatt in the case of dBm and 1 watt in the case of dBW. A power of n watts equals 10 log n dBW; conversely, a power of p dBW equals 10(p/10) watts. The same formulas link dBm to milliwatts. An increase of 10 dBm or 10 dBW represents a 10-fold increase in power. Since 1 watt = 1000 milliwatts, 0 dBW = 30 dBm. dBu: A logarithmic unit of power, similar to dBm but computed from voltage measurements. The reference level is 0.775 volts, the voltage which generates a power of 1 milliwatt across a circuit having an impedance of 600 ohms. A voltage of V volts corresponds to a power of 20·log10(V/0.775) dBu. decibel (dB): A customary logarithmic measure most commonly used (in various ways) for measuring sound. The human ear is capable of detecting an enormous range of sound intensities. Furthermore, our perception is not linear. Experiment shows that when humans perceive one sound to be twice as loud as another, in fact the louder sound is about ten times as intense as the fainter one. For this reason, sound is measured on logarithmic scales. Informally, if one sound is 1 bel (10 decibels) \"louder\" than another, this means the louder sound is 10 times louder than the fainter one. A difference of 20 decibels corresponds to an increase of 10 x 10 or 100 times in intensity. The beginning of the scale, 0 decibels, can be set in different ways, depending on exactly which aspect of sound is being measured. See also dB- (above). DROP FRAME: A method of adjusting the nominal 30 frame per second counting rate of SMPTE 12M time code to the actual counting rate of approximately 29.97 frames per second – a difference of 1 part in 1001.

QUICK START GUIDE This quick start guide discusses the major steps in getting a new installation of a 5700MSC-IP up and running. 1.2.1. Mounting and Power Connections The 5700MSC chassis holds the main board, one power supply, and one fan module. Dual power supplies are an available option in which case a second power supply replaces the fan module. The chassis has built-in rack mounting ears and fits in a standard 19” rack. Two fans on each side cool the unit. Clearance of 2” (5cm) must be maintained around the fan exhausts on either side of the chassis. The power supply operates from an AC line frequency of 50Hz to 60Hz, at 100V-240V (auto-sensing). The fan module runs off of the single power supply. The power consumption of a 5700MSC is 125 Watts with all options installed. If dual power supplies are fitted, they should both be supplied with AC power. Each power supply has its own IEC C14 AC power inlet. The inlets are isolated from each other and can be powered by the same AC power source but ideally should be powered from different AC sources for true redundancy. If both supplies are not powered, the unpowered supply will trigger a system fault. A redundant power supply may be added at any time to a unit by removing the fan module and installing the second power supply. The fan module is hot swappable and the power supplies are hot swappable when configured with dual power supplies. The fan module and power supplies can accessed from the front of the unit by removing the front panel. Each power supply and fan module has a Phillips mounting screw at the front that can be used to secure the module in order to prevent accidental removal. 1.2.2. Front Panel Installation The 5700MSC comes with a removable front panel that is equipped with two color LCD screens, along with 10 pushbuttons, and a control knob for navigating the menu system and configuring the unit. The front panel is secured by the two thumbscrews on either end. The front panel can be removed and re- installed while the unit is running to provide access to the power supplies and for troubleshooting purposes. When re-installing the front panel be sure to fully tighten the thumb screws.  Note: Care should be taken when handling the front panel to not inadvertently disconnect the ribbon cable connection on the 7800MSC-IP card or the 5700-AUX card. When AC power is applied to the 5700MSC and the power supplies are switched on, the unit will start up automatically. The front panel should become operative within approximately 30 seconds. 1.2.3. Configuring the Ethernet Ports Press the GENERAL button on the front panel to access the general setup menu. This menu can be used to configure the two Ethernet ports on the 5700MSC. Both the GigE 1 port and the GigE 2 port are used to carry mission-critical data, such as PTP and PCR. The current menu selection will be indicated by the > character. Rotate the control knob or press the  and  buttons to select the IP Control menu item and press the SELECT button or depress the knob. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 1-12 Revision 0.1 OVERVIEW Assign an unused IP address and subnet mask to the GigE 1 and/or GigE 2 ports. The two ports must be on separate subnets in order to function properly. When entering an IP address, the control knob can be used to set each octet. Depress the control knob while turning to adjust in larger steps. The Ethernet link status and current IP settings can be viewed by pressing the STATUS button and selecting the Ethernet GigE 1 or the Ethernet GigE 2 status screens. If SNMP monitoring or control of the unit is desired, the SNMP feature must first be enabled (it is disabled by default). Select the GENERAL menu and press ESC to return to the root menu. Scroll down to EngineeringMenu and press SELECT. A password is required to enable the engineering menu items. Press SELECT on Password and use the  and  buttons or control knob to enter each digit of the numeric password and then press SELECT. The default password is 5700. The SNMP menu should now be accessible and SNMP can be enabled through SNMP Ctl. The trap addresses must be assigned if SNMP traps are required to be sent to remote logging software such as VistaLINK® Pro. Contact Evertz customer service if a MIB to the 5700MSC is required. Note that the Frame port should be used as the primary management interface. 1.2.4. Selecting and Connecting Frequency References Pressing the INPUT button on the front panel will select the input menu. From here the frequency and time references of the unit can be configured. Use the control knob to select the Frequency Ref menu item and press SELECT or depress the knob. The Reference Src menu item selects six different ways the 5700MSC can lock its master oscillator.  GNSS Mobile – The 5700MSC will look for a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) antenna attached to the GPS port on the back of the unit. This mode is intended for applications where the location of the GNSS antenna is movable such as mobile production trucks. Start-up time before receiving data is optimized assuming the location may have changed from the previous time.  GNSS Fixed – The 5700MSC will look for a GNSS antenna attached to the GPS port on the back of the unit. This mode is intended for applications where the location of the GNSS antenna is fixed. Start-up time before receiving data will be longer the first time the unit is first powered up as the antenna determines the fixed location. Subsequent start-up times will be shorter as the unit assumes the GPS location has not changed from the previous time.  The GPS Enable and GLONASS Enable menu items in the Engineering Menu control whether the receiver will lock to satellites from the GPS and/or GLONASS Global Navigation Satellite Systems. With either the GNSS Mobile or GNSS Fixed menu choices, the ovenized oscillator inside the 5700MSC will lock to the 1PPS pulse from the GNSS antenna. This provides a very accurate frequency reference to the unit. The high precision time and date provided by the GNSS antenna is used to phase the outputs of the 5700MSC by referencing them to a specific point in GNSS time. Multiple 5700MSC units locked to GNSS will all have the same phase on their outputs. This also means the time reference will be forced to GNSS.  Ten MHz – The 5700MSC will look for a 5MHz or 10MHz reference on its reference loop input, frame reference 1, or frame reference 2. The 5MHz/10MHz reference should come from a 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OVERVIEW Revision 0.1 Page 1-13 source that has higher stability than the internal oscillator of the 5700MSC such as a Rubidium or Caesium frequency standard. A 5MHz or 10MHz reference does not provide any phase information and the phase of the outputs will not be the same between different 5700MSC units.  Video – The 5700MSC will genlock to an analog black burst or HD tri-level reference applied to its reference loop input, frame reference 1, or frame reference 2. The frequency stability of the 5700MSC will be only as good as that of the reference input. The phase of the outputs will be aligned to that of the reference input.  Internal – The 5700MSC will free run on its internal high stability ovenized oscillator. Select this option if no external reference is available to the unit.  1588 – The 5700MSC can synchronize with a PTP master to determine a frequency reference. There are three other menu items that control how the 5700MSC locks to its reference. These are Genlock Range, Genlock Source, and Lock type. Press the HELP button for a short description on what each menu item does. 1.2.5. Selecting and Connecting Time References Once the desired frequency reference has been selected and the antenna/reference connections have been made, the time reference should be selected. The time reference is how the 5700MSC obtains time and date for the system clock. Press the INPUT button to access the input menu. Return to the root level by pressing ESC a few times. Select the Time menu using the control knob and press SELECT. Use the Reference Src menu item to choose a time reference for the unit. There are other menu items that control how the 5700MSC handles the time reference. Press the HELP button to identify the function of each item.  GNSS – When a GPS or GLONASS receiver is connected to the unit, it can obtain continuous time and date updates from GNSS. If the frequency reference has been set to one of the GNSS modes, the time reference will also be forced to GNSS. However it is also possible to use a frequency reference other than GNSS (such as video) and still use GNSS as a very accurate time reference. See note above regarding GLONASS operation.  VITC – The 5700MSC will look for Vertical Interval Time Code on the selected line of a black burst signal that is applied to the reference loop input, frame reference 1, or frame reference 2. It can also decode date information from the user bits in several different formats. In order to use VITC as a time reference, the frequency reference must first be set to Video.  None – The 5700MSC will not acquire time from any outside source. The time and date must be manually entered using the front panel in the GENERAL menu. The high frequency stability of the unit and battery backup will ensure the 5700MSC keeps fairly accurate time.  SNTP – The 5700MSC can synchronize once daily to time and date from an NTP server.  1588 – The 5700MSC can synchronize with a PTP master to determine the time and date. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 1-14 Revision 0.1 OVERVIEW 1.2.6. Checking the Status of the Unit After the input references are connected and set up, the status of the unit can be checked by pressing the STATUS button on the front panel. There are several different status screens which can be selected by using the control knob or the  and  buttons. The status of the frequency and time references can be viewed by choosing the Lock status screen and pressing SELECT. Press ESC to return to the status menu to select another screen for viewing. Any screen name that is highlighted with a red or yellow background indicates that one of the statuses in that screen is in a fault or warning condition. Figure 1-2: 5700MSC Rear Panel View 1.2.7. Wiring the Outputs Most outputs are provided as Mini-BNC connectors and wiring is straightforward. The GigE 1 and GigE 2 ports use a standard RJ-45 connector, and the 10GbE ports require an SFP10G-TR13-A (not included). 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OVERVIEW Revision 0.1 Page 1-15 1.2.8. Configuring the Sync Outputs The sync outputs of the 5700MSC are configured in the OUTPUT menu, accessed by pressing the OUTPUT button. All sync outputs are derived from the master oscillator and will be locked in frequency and phase. The sync outputs are all programmable to output several different sync types and can be phased independently from each other. In the OUTPUT menu, the sync outputs are configured using the SYNC 1 to SYNC 6 sub-menus. Each sync output can set to output any number of black burst or HD tri-level standards. They are all phased independently. When configuring a sync output, the mode must be selected first. By default, the mode of all sync outputs are set to NTSC-M black burst for North American units, and PAL-B black burst for European units. Configure the mode of each sync output to the format desired for the installation. Note that with +AUX option, the 10MHz and WC outputs may also be configured as sync outputs. There are numerous other configuration settings for each sync output, some may be disabled (dark text) or enabled (white text) depending on the output mode selected. Scroll over each of the available menu items and press the HELP button for more information on the function of each menu item. 1.2.9. Configuring the Test Generator Outputs The unit has been equipped with four video test generators on Mini-BNC outputs. Each generator can output a number of SDTG, HDTG, or 3GTG options. These are configured in the TG 1, TG 2, TG 3, and TG4 menus. All test generators are derived from the master oscillator and will be automatically locked in frequency and phase. The test generators are independent from one another and can be configured to different formats and different phase offsets. By default, all phases will be aligned to the selected frequency reference. The unit also has two 10GbE ports that can output test generators if the +10G-TG option is ordered. Each 10GbE port can output 3 test generators, which can be configured in the TG 5, IP 1a; TG6, IP1b; TG7, IP1c; TG8, IP2a; TG9, IP2b; and TG10, IP 2c menus. The quickest and easiest way to discover how to configure the outputs is to scroll through the available menu items and press the HELP button for a description of each menu item function. 1.2.10. Configuring the Time Outputs All time outputs from the unit come from the System Time clock. This clock can be viewed by pressing the STATUS button and selecting the System/In time screen. When the time reference is obtained from a GNSS sources, the system time will be Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). UTC time is the same at all locations around the world. In order to output local time, the Time Zone must be selected to match the time zone offset of your location. For example, in North America, Eastern Standard Time (EST) is UTC –5:00 hours. Central Standard Time (CST) is UTC –6:00 hours. Mountain Standard Time (MST) is UTC –7:00 hours. Pacific Standard Time is UTC –8:00 hours. The 5700MSC also supports Daylight Savings Time, which must be enabled separately for each time output. Below are descriptions of the time outputs available from the 5700MSC.  Sync Outputs – When a Sync output mode is set to NTSC-M or PAL-B black burst, VITC time can be inserted onto two lines in the vertical blanking interval. The VITC is controlled by the Vitc Ctl, Vitc Line 1, Vitc Line 2, Dropframe Ctl, Color Frame, Set Jam Time, Jam Output, Jam all Vitc, Time offset, Time Zone, and DST enable menu items. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 1-16 Revision 0.1 OVERVIEW  Server Protocols – The 5700MSC will support Network Time Protocol and Precision Time Protocols. These are configured by pressing the GENERAL button and entering the NTP rules, PTP All ports, PTP GigE 1, PTP GigE 2, PTP 10G 1, and PTP 10G 2 sub-menus. The 5700MSC hosts an NTP server and also sends out periodic NTP broadcasts. NTP time should always be UTC. PTP broadcast rates are determined using the PTP sub-menus listed above.  Test Generator Outputs – Timecode can be “burned-in” at the bottom of any of the the 5700MSC test signal outputs. These are configured by pressing the OUTPUT button and entering the appropriate TG menu. The time is controlled by the TC Burn In, Dropframe Ctl, Set Jam Time, Jam Output, Jam all VitcLtc, Time Offset, Time Zone, and DST enable sub-menu items. 1.2.11. Final Steps of Set Up and Securing all Connections Once the 5700MSC has been configured, the various STATUS screens should be checked to ensure there are no items displayed with a red or yellow background. The left LCD screen should show “Sys OK” and “Ref OK” with a green background in the bottom corners. The power supply and fan modules (accessed by removing the front panel) should be secured to the chassis by fastening the Phillips mounting screw. The GPS D-Sub connector on the back of the unit should be secured to the 5700MSC using mounting screws. The AC power cords can be fixed to the unit using the retaining clips provided. 1.2.12. Access Control The engineering menu password can be changed from the default to prevent unauthorized tampering of SNMP and menu access control settings. The SNMP Ctl menu item can be changed to SNMP off or SNMP status to prevent remote SNMP control of the unit. Furthermore, pressing the PANEL LOCK button can lock the front panel. This prevents accidental changes by someone bumping or leaning into the front panel. The front panel can be unlocked by pressing the SELECT and PANEL LOCK buttons simultaneously. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-1 2. THEORY OF OPERATION The 5700MSC-IP is equipped with six programmable sync outputs along with a 10MHz and a Wordclock output. When equipped with a test generator option (+SDI-TG, +10G-TG, +AUX), analog/digital audio and analog/digital video outputs will be available. 2.1. Outputs 2.1.1. Sync Outputs The sync output section provides six sync outputs along with a 10MHz and a Wordclock output. The 10MHz and Wordclock outputs can be configured as additional sync outputs, if required. All sync outputs are generated from the master oscillator and will be locked in frequency to the selected reference. Most sync output types will be phase locked to the reference, depending on the reference type and the phase information supplied (see section 2.2.1). When a video sync mode is selected, an independent phase offset can be applied to the output. The sync outputs are configured from the OUTPUT root menu. See section Error! Reference source not found. for more information. All sync outputs are fully programmable to output several different sync formats by changing the sync mode. The different output modes are described below: Black Burst Signals NTSC-M PAL-B There are two color black output modes, one in NTSC-M format and the other in PAL-B format. These modes are referred to as “black burst” or “color black” because they contain black video and have a colorburst to provide a colorframe reference. Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC) can be inserted on up to two lines in these modes. Additionally, a SMPTE ST 318 ten-field reference can be inserted onto line 15 for the NTSC-M output mode. Both these outputs modes can be phased independently over the entire color frame sequence. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-2 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION HD Tri-Level Signals North American 1080i/60 1080i/59.94 1080p/60 1080p/59.94 1080p/30 1080p/29.97 720p/60 720p/59.94 720p/30 European 1080i/50 1080p/50 1080p/25 720p/50 Film Standards 1080p/24 1080p/24sF 1080p/23.98 1080p/23.98sF 720p/24 Analog tri-level sync output modes are available for a variety of HD formats. These outputs are generated according to SMPTE ST 274 and SMPTE ST 296. All tri-level sync formats can be phased independently. If the 1035i/59.94 format is required, select 1080i/59.94. These sync formats are identical to each other. Similarly, if 1035i/60 is required, select 1080i/60. The 1080p/30sF, 1080p/29.97sF, and 1080p/25sF sync formats are identical to the 1080i/60, 1080i/59.94, and 1080i/50 output modes available here. The 1080p/60, 1080p/59.94, and 1080p/50 sync formats can be used for 3G 1080p synchronization, but contain no field information. The 1080i/60, 1080i/59.94, and 1080i/50 formats should be used instead, whenever possible. Continuous Wave (CW) Signals 10MHz 5MHz NTSC-M Subcarrier PAL-B Subcarrier The continuous wave (CW) output modes produce a sine wave at a specific frequency. The 10MHz and 5MHz outputs are locked in frequency to the reference but are not phased with respect to the reference. The NTSC Subcarrier (3.579MHz) is phase locked only when using either GPS or NTSC black burst as a reference. It will be inverted (180º out of phase) with respect to a proper NTSC subcarrier and is better described as a “burst-locked sinewave”. The PAL Subcarrier (4.434MHz) is phase locked only when using GPS or PAL black burst as a reference. It is generated at sine (U) phase. Wordclock Wordclock The wordclock output mode produces a square wave at 48kHz. It is high during subframe1 (left channel) and low during subframe2 (right channel). Sync outputs that are set to wordclock cannot be independently phased. There is a single global wordclock phase control in the AES Audio menu. The wordclock output amplitude is set with the Wordclock level menu item. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-3 Pulse Signals 1Hz 1/1.001Hz 6/1.001Hz PAL Colorframe IRIG1 Datum The pulse output modes provide timing pulses that can be used to lock downstream equipment or can be helpful for troubleshooting purposes. These outputs cannot be phased and always remain phase-locked to the frequency reference. These signals may not be affected by any global phase offset (refer to Table 2-1). The pulse type is set with the Pulse type menu item. Refer to the pulse diagrams in Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2 for timing relationships. The 1Hz pulse goes high at the beginning of each second. The 1/1.001Hz pulse indicates the start of the second for 29.97Hz LTC/VITC rates and is also synchronized to NTSC color field 1. Will be high for the duration of NTSC color field 1. The 6/1.001Hz pulse indicates where 59.94Hz video coincides with the 23.98Hz standards. This pulse is only phase locked when using a GNSS reference or NTSC with a ten-field pulse. The PAL Colorframe pulse will be high during PAL color field 1. It will only be phase locked when referenced to GNSS or a PAL-B reference. The IRIG1 Datum pulse will go high at the start of the IRIG second for 100ms. This pulse will be aligned within 20 microseconds of the GNSS 1PPS pulse when locked to a GNSS reference. 10MHz Output Description will be included in upcoming release. Bi-Level Description will be included in upcoming release. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-4 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION 2.1.2. Test Generator Options A variety of audio and video test generators are available. +SDI-TG and +10G-TG Options:  Serial Digital Interface Test Generators (SDI TGs). There are four independent test generators. The SDI-TG option provides the capability to generate Standard Definition formats. The HDTG option adds the ability to generate High Definition formats. The 3GTG option adds the ability to generate 3G formats as well as dual-link formats. The 3GTG option also includes 3D test patterns in various formats. All test generators have an audio embedder and can generate audio tones in up to four groups of audio. They also feature a 2-line configurable on-screen message display and timecode burn-in window at the bottom of the image. +AUX Option:  Analog Audio test generators. Two channels, Left & Right. Supplied as balanced outputs on the AUDIO terminal block. Can be configured to output continuous, or timed audio tones.  Digital Audio test generators. Two AES outputs with configurable audio tones and a silent DARS output. Provided as unbalanced outputs on BNC connectors and also as balanced, isolated outputs on the AUDIO terminal block 2.1.3. Global Pedestal Control There is a single control to enable or disable applying 7.5IRE setup to all sync outputs. This control only affects the NTSC-M output format. This control is located in the OUTPUT root menu. 2.1.4. Global Phase Controls The Global Phase feature of the 5700MSC-IP provides a single point of control from which all video outputs can be phased simultaneously. There are separate controls for each of the frequency lock modes (GPS, Video, 10MHz, and Internal) to allow different phase offsets to be applied depending on the lock source. This global phase allows for phase correction to be applied when locking to a 10MHz reference. See section Error! Reference source not found. for information on how to enable and specify a global phase offset.  The “10MHz” and “Internal” global phase settings are reset to zero at startup. This is done because no phasing information is supplied in these reference modes and the phase of the outputs will be random when the unit is restarted. Once enabled, the global phase offset can be specified in milliseconds, microseconds, and nanoseconds. The global phase offset is applied before the individual phase controls for each output. Refer to Table 2-1 for a list of all the outputs affected and the minimum phasing resolution for each. The outputs unaffected by global phase will remain locked to the reference. The Global Phasing menu in the OUTPUT root menu is used to configure global phase. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-5 Output Affected by Global Phase Minimum Phasing Resolution Sync – NTSC & PAL modes Yes 1 ns Sync – Tri-level modes Yes 1 ns Sync – 5MHZ/10MHZ CW modes No - Sync – NTSC/PAL subcarrier modes No - Sync – PAL Color Frame Pulse No - Sync – 1Hz and 1/1.001Hz Pulses No - Sync – 6/1.001Hz pulse No - Sync – Wordclock Yes 59 ns IRIG Datum Pulse Yes 1 ms AES/DARS outputs (+AUX Option only) Yes 163 ns LTC outputs (+AUX Option only) Yes 1 us SDI TG outputs (+SDI-TG and +10G- TG Options only) Yes 37 ns SD 13.5 ns HD & 3G Table 2-1: Global Phasing Characteristics 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-6 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION Figure 2-1: IRIG-B127 Format and Alignment to IRIG1 Datum Pulse Figure 2-2: 29.97Hz LTC Format and Alignment to NTSC Video PrP0 1 0 M P11 0 1 0 1 Seconds 1 1 10 0 0 0M M P2 1 100 0 0M M P3 1 1 10 0 0M P4 M M P5 10 0 0 0M P6 0 0 0 0 P7 0 0 0 P8 Minutes Hours 0 Days 1 0 1 1 Year M M M MM 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 Control Bits 1-9 Control Bits 10-18 0 0 P90 0 Straight Binary Seconds Bits 0-8 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 Straight Binary Seconds Bits 9-17 11 10 0 0 M IRIG1 Datum Pulse IRIG Output – Amplitude Modulated 1kHz Sinewave P0 IRIG-B127 – 100 bits/second LEGEND Pr = Reference Bit P0 … P9 = Position Identifier Bits M = Index Marker Bit (always 0) 29.97Hz LTC VITC field 1 line 14 Field 1 NTSC Black Burst - One Frame (33.367ms) Field 2 VITC field 2 line 14 Sync Word 1 Frames 1 1 0 0 BG1 0 0 0 0 0 10Fr 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 BG2 Seconds BG3 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 10sec 1 BG4 0 1 1 0 Minutes 0 0 0 1 BG5 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 10min 0BGF0BG6 0 0 0 0 Hours 1 0 0 0 BG7 0 0 0 0 1 0 10Hr 0 0 BG7 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1BGF1BGF2Pol.

Genlock 2.2.1. Frequency Locking At the heart of the 5700MSC-IP is the master oscillator circuit. Refer to the block diagram in Figure 2-5 below. For maximum versatility and reliability, two separate oscillators are employed. In narrow mode, an ovenized quartz oscillator (OCXO) is used for maximum stability. In wide mode, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCXO) provides a wide lock range and fast lock times. For added reliability this dual configuration allows the unused oscillator to act as a backup to the active oscillator. In the case of a hardware fault the backup oscillator will take over. See section 2.2.3 for more information. Figure 2-5: Main Oscillator Circuit Block Diagram The 5700MSC-IP can be configured to free-run on its internal reference, or it can lock its oscillator to an available frequency reference. This locking operation uses a Phase Lock Loop (PLL) to continuously adjust the oscillator to track the frequency and phase of the reference signal. In narrow mode an additional feature is available whereby the adjustment rate of the oscillator is limited to prevent sudden changes during a re-locking operation (see Slow mode in section 2.2.4). The 5700MSC-IP can lock to several different frequency reference types. The supported signal types are shown in Table 2-2. Video and Continuous Wave (CW) signals are applied to the reference loop BNCs and are auto-detected. A GPS receiver can also be connected to the unit and used as a frequency reference (see section 2.5). Each reference type is explained in detail in the following sections.

Selecting the Frequency Reference Type The frequency reference for the 5700MSC-IP is selected with the Freq Reference Src menu item in the Frequency Ref menu off the INPUT root menu. When GPS is selected, the 5700MSC-IP will use the GNSS receiver attached to the GPS port on the rear of the unit (see section 2.2.13). When set to Ten MHz, the 5700MSC-IP will look for a 5MHz or 10MHz continuous wave (CW) signal on the reference loop input BNCs (see section 2.2.12). When set to Video, the 5700MSC-IP will lock to an analog video sync signal (auto-detected) that is applied to the reference loop BNCs (see section 2.2.5). When set to Internal, the 5700MSC-IP will free-run off its internal reference (see section 2.2.12.1). The Inputs status screen in the STATUS root menu can be used to view which frequency references have been detected by the 5700MSC-IP. The first three lines indicate status of video sync, 5MHz or 10MHz detection, and GNSS status. See section 4.1.2 for more information. 2.2.3. Selecting the Genlock Range The Genlock Range menu item in the Frequency Ref menu selects which oscillator is used when locking to a video sync or CW reference. When Narrow is selected, the high-stability oven controlled quartz oscillator (OCXO) is used and the VCXO runs as backup. When Wide is selected, the voltage controlled quartz oscillator (VCXO) is used and the OCXO runs as backup. It should be noted that when the frequency reference source is set to GPS or Internal Ref, the genlock range is forced to Narrow mode (OCXO) regardless of this menu setting. In the event that the frequency reference is lost, the 5700MSC-IP will free-run using the selected oscillator. The Narrow range OCXO has extremely high stability which will translate to very low drift. This also translates into lower jitter on the outputs. Another advantage of the Narrow range is that it allows use of the Slow re-lock mode that prevents glitches when re-locking to a reference (see section 2.2.4). The disadvantages of the Narrow range are that it requires a very tight reference source (±0.1 PPM) and requires a longer time to fully lock. The OCXO also requires five minutes of warm-up time before reaching full stability once the unit has been powered on. The Wide range VCXO provides very fast lock times with a wide lock range (±15 PPM) which means it can lock to just about any reference signal. It can be useful if the 5700MSC-IP reference source changes frequently such as in a post-production facility. The Wide range cannot be used when locking to GNSS or when free-running on the internal reference. In almost all cases, the Narrow range is superior and should be left as the default selection. See Table 2-3 for a summary of the characteristics of each range. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-10 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION  In the event that the frequency reference is lost when locked in Wide mode, the 5700MSC-IP will freerun on its VCXO. Note that this oscillator can freerun at a frequency outside the Narrow mode lock range which may cause problems for downstream 5700MSC-IP units. The Wide oscillator is also capable of going beyond the frequency tolerance specifications stated in ITU-R BT.601 and SMPTE ST 292-1. Operating outside the range of ±10ppm may cause locking issues for downstream equipment. Genlock Range Oscillator Lock Range Time to Lock Jitter Free-run Drift Narrow OCXO ± 0.1 PPM >20 seconds very low very low Wide VCXO ± 15 PPM <1 second Low moderate Table 2-3: Genlock Range Characteristics The status of the reference and lock progress can be monitored on the Lock Status screen, accessed by pressing the STATUS button and selecting Lock Status (see section 4.1.2). The current position within the tuning range of the selected oscillator is shown as OCXO center or WIDE center. It is displayed as a percentage (+100% to –100%) of the total tuning range. This reading gives an idea of how close to the edges of the tuning range the oscillator is when locked to a reference. The Narrow range OCXO oscillator ages over time and the center frequency may drift. It is important that despite any drift it retains the ability to lock to a precision frequency source such as GNSS or a rubidium/cesium frequency standard. Such frequency sources are extremely accurate. The oscillator is guaranteed from the factory to lock to such a reference within ±10% of the center of its tuning range. The aging of the oscillator is 10% maximum for the first year, and 5% for every year thereafter. This translates to an expected lifetime of 15 years. If the oscillator locks at over ±90% of its tuning range, a warning condition will be indicated and the status line will be shown in Red. Keep in mind that the OCXO center value is only meaningful when locked to a very accurate frequency reference. The 5700MSC-IP monitors the condition of both oscillators at all times. If an oscillator problem is detected, the unit will seamlessly switch to the unused oscillator and report an internal hardware fault. This will activate the Hw Fail message on the front panel and can also send out an SNMP trap. If such a fault occurs, it is not advisable to power down or attempt to restart the unit. Contact Evertz customer service for further assistance at +1 905-335-7570 or see www.evertz.com/support. 2.2.4. Lock Type Selection When the Genlock Range is set to Narrow, the Lock Type controls how the 5700MSC-IP will respond when its oscillator becomes out of sync to the frequency reference. This situation can occur if the incoming frequency reference changes or is reconnected after a period of absence long enough that the 5700MSC-IP oscillator has drifted and is no longer synchronized. There are two lock types available: Slow and Abrupt. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-11 In the Abrupt mode, the 5700MSC-IP will respond to any change in the incoming frequency reference with an immediate re-lock, shifting the timing of the unit to match the reference. This effect will ripple to the outputs and may cause undesired effects in downstream equipment, depending on the amount of correction performed. This is the default mode of operation. When the Genlock Range menu item is set to Wide, the relocking mode is always Abrupt, regardless of the Lock Type menu setting. When the Slow lock mode is selected, the 5700MSC-IP will detect when its oscillator is not synchronized to the reference and issue a frequency reference unlocked warning. It will display REF JAM NEEDED on the left LCD display and can also be configured to send out an SNMP trap (see section Error! Reference source not found.). It will then gradually adjust the frequency of the OCXO, limiting the rate of change, until the oscillator is brought back into sync with the incoming reference. Once this “slow” re-lock process is complete, the “REF JAM REQUIRED” warning will be cleared. The Lock progress display will return to 100% and the unit will continue normal operation. The Slow lock type can take a long time to relock to the reference signal, especially when correcting for a large discrepancy in phase. It takes about a minute to correct for a phase difference of one line of video. At any time during this Slow relock process, the operator can force the 5700MSC-IP to immediately lock to the reference by performing a frequency jam. This can be performed by selecting Jam Reference in the Jam Input menu off the INPUT root menu. It can also be performed remotely through SNMP. Once the Jam Reference has been initiated, the frequency and phase from the reference is jammed into the main oscillator, forcing it to lock immediately. Performing a Jam may cause disturbances on all sync and test generator outputs as the phase of the unit is reset. Careful consideration and testing of Slow lock mode effects should be made, especially when using multiple 5700MSC-IP units locked to each other. Portable truck systems that may require a cold start of all equipment should allow for some time for oscillator warm-up and GNSS lock but could require a manual frequency jam to be performed in order to get units locked up quickly.  When the unit is first started up, or if the frequency reference source is changed by the user, a frequency jam is always performed. This jam occurs even if the Lock Type has been set to Slow mode. When locked to GNSS, this initial frequency jam could occur 5 to 30 minutes after the unit has been restarted, once GNSS lock is fully established.  If a large shift in the reference occurs while Slow lock mode is enabled, the outputs of the 5700MSC-IP may be out of phase for a long time while re-locking. The 5700MSC-IP will gradually slew its oscillator to bring it back into phase with the reference. This slewing action combined with the apparent phase shift may seem to indicate that the unit is completely unlocked to the reference and freerunning. This should not be considered a fault. A manual jam can be performed at any time to force the 5700MSC-IP to lock immediately. 2.2.5. Video Genlock Operation The 5700MSC-IP can lock to various analog video sync references including NTSC, PAL, Slo-Pal signals, and HD tri-level signals. The applied video reference type is auto detected. The full list of supported standards is shown in Table 2-4. The lock behavior is described for each of the main video sync types. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-12 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION Video Signal Frequency Lock Phase Lock NTSC-M Sync edge/Burst 2 Color Frames NTSC-M + 10field Sync edge/Burst 5 Frames PAL-B Sync edge/Burst 4 Color Frames 625i/48 Sync edge 1 Frame 625i/47.95 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080i/60 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080i/59.94 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080i/50 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/60 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/59.94 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/50 Sync edge 1 Frame 720p/60 Sync edge 1 Frame 720p/59.94 Sync edge 1 Frame 720p/50 Sync edge 1 Frame 720p/24 Sync edge 1 Frame 720p/30 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/23.98 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/23.98sF Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/24 Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/24sF Sync edge 1 Frame 1080p/25 Sync edge 1 Frame 480p/59.94 Sync edge 1 Frame Table 2-4: Supported Analog Video Sync References 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-13 2.2.6. Serial Digital Video Timing The 5700MSC-IP has four separate serial digital video test generators that can be phased independently, and are also phased by the Global Phase controls. In all the supported standards, SD, HD, and 3G, the video outputs are aligned to the supplied reference. The alignment to analog sync has been calibrated using SMPTE compliant timing and is guaranteed to be accurate to within one sample. It should be noted that certain Tektronix equipment such as the WFM700 and WFM7120 will not show correct alignment of a serial digital video source to a supplied external analog reference. These devices appear to have been calibrated to the output of an unknown video DAC. This means they will not display correct SMPTE timing due to the delay introduced in the measurements by the DAC process. Since the outputs of the 5700MSC-IP are aligned using SMPTE timing, their phase must be advanced significantly in order to appear correct with Tektronix timing.  With no phase offset applied, the SDI outputs of the 5700MSC-IP will be measured by Tektronix gear as approximately 4.7us delayed (SD) or 1.3us delayed (HD) when the Tektronix device is externally referenced to the respective analog sync Examples of equipment that perform SMPTE compliant timing measurements are the Phabrix SX/DX and OmniTek OTM-1000. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-14 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION 2.2.7.

The master oscillator will lock its frequency to the NTSC video reference, and all outputs will become frequency locked. This frequency locking process uses both the horizontal sync and the colorburst to obtain an accurate lock. The applied NTSC reference should have no video content and a low Subcarrier to Horizontal (SCH) offset to assure proper lock. The approximate SCH value is shown in the Inputs status screen (see section 4.1.2). If the SCH error is higher than 30º, the 5700MSC-IP will fall back to locking to the horizontal edge of the video only. If the SCH error is in excess of 50º, or the colorburst cannot be accurately measured, the 5700MSC-IP will report that the applied reference is unlockable. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-15  It is important to ensure that the incoming black burst reference is of good quality. The reference loop BNCs are isolated from chassis ground and the signal is received differentially. This provides good immunity to DC offsets and provides common- mode hum rejection. There should be no video content on the reference otherwise reference lock could be lost, or higher jitter may be produced on the outputs. The color frame sequence of the NTSC reference is decoded and used to phase the outputs. Because the NTSC color frame sequence is only 2 frames long, this is not enough phase information to deterministically lock signals which align to NTSC on longer periods. This includes 23.98Hz standards, DARS/AES signals, and the 6/1.001Hz pulse. These signals align with NTSC once every 5 frames. This is illustrated in Figure 2-4. The phase of these signals will be set arbitrarily and cannot be guaranteed to be the same between different units that are locked to the same reference. The phase may also change if the unit is restarted. The phase locking ability of the 5700MSC-IP when supplied with an NTSC reference is summarized at the bottom of the lock diagram (Figure 2-6). The HD standards listed apply to both the HD test generators and the tri-level sync outputs. The serial digital video test generator outputs are phased according to SMPTE compliant timing, which may differ from the timing shown on Tektronix equipment. See the note in section 2.2.6. If the NTSC reference is lost, the unit will freerun on the selected oscillator as described in section 2.2.3. Note than when the Genlock Range is set to Wide, the freerun drift upon loss of reference will be much higher. When the NTSC reference is re-applied the Lock Type menu selection controls how the 5700MSC-IP will respond to re-align its internal oscillator with the reference (see section 2.2.4). When locked to NTSC without a ten-field reference, the AES/DARS outputs cannot be deterministically phased. The AES/DARS/WC lck menu item located in the AES Audio menu off the OUTPUT root menu should be set to NTSC/fractional, however the phase relationship will be chosen arbitrarily and may change if the reference is lost or the unit is restarted. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-16 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION 2.2.8.

The ten-field reference provides 5 frames worth of phasing information that allows deterministic locking of 23.98Hz standards, the 6/1.001Hz pulse, and DARS/AES signals. These outputs can be guaranteed to be the same phase between multiple units. The color frame sequence of the NTSC reference is also decoded and used for phasing NTSC sync outputs. Note that the lock diagram above (Figure 2-7) now shows a span of 5 frames instead of 2 frames for regular NTSC lock (Figure 2-6). 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-17 The SMPTE ST 318 ten-field reference can be generated by the 5700MSC-IP on any NTSC sync output. It is turned on and off using the Ten Field Ctl menu item. The 10field waveform is illustrated below in Figure 2-8. The number of pulses indicates where in the sequence the frame belongs. It is inserted on lines 15 (field 1) and 278 (field 2). 2 3 4 5 Start Pulse Field2 Pulse Line 15 1 Figure 2-8: SMPTE ST 318 Ten-field Reference on NTSC line 15  Note that AES/DARS Test Generator Outputs are only available on the +AUX option. When the 5700MSC-IP is locked to an NTSC reference with a ten-field pulse, the AES, DARS, and Wordclock outputs can be phase locked properly. The AES/DARS/WC lck menu item located in the AES Audio menu off the OUTPUT root menu should be set to NTSC/fractional. In the NTSC ten-field lock diagram above (Figure 2-7), the AES/DARS outputs are displayed as frames. Each frame is divided into two subframes, labeled X and Y. The X subframe identifies channel 1 (left channel). The Y subframe identifies channel 2 (right channel). The wordclock output is high during channel 1 and low during channel 2. Note that the AES/DARS and wordclock outputs can be phased independently. If the phase of the AES/DARS outputs is changed for any reason, the phase of the wordclock output should be changed as well to match. The AES/DARS outputs provide a fixed sample rate of 48kHz (48,000 samples per second). This means that during a single NTSC frame, 1601.6 AES frames will have been generated. It takes five NTSC frames to fit a whole number of AES frames (8008 frames). This means that 48kHz AES/DARS will line up evenly with NTSC sync once out of every five frames, and during the other four frames the AES/DARS waveforms will appear to be partially shifted. The 10field sequence identifies frame #1 (a single pulse) as the frame where the AES/DARS waveforms line up perfectly to horizontal sync of line 4 of the NTSC waveform. This is illustrated in lock diagram #2 (Figure 2-7). Note that the Z preamble (which identifies the start of a 192-frame AES block) will only line up with NTSC sync once every 120 frames (4.004 seconds). This is in contrast to PAL sync where it will line up every frame. This essentially renders the AES Coarse phase adjustment meaningless when locked to an NTSC reference. The alignment of an AES block to analog video sync is not important for proper reception of an AES signal. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-18 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION If the NTSC reference is lost, the unit will freerun on the selected oscillator as described in section 2.2.3. Note than when the Genlock Range is set to Wide, the freerun drift upon loss of reference will be much higher.

The color frame sequence is decoded from the PAL reference and provides a 4 frame phase reference. As with NTSC references, the 5700MSC-IP locks to both the horizontal sync edges and colorbursts of the PAL reference. If the Subcarrier to Horizontal sync error is higher than 30º the 5700MSC-IP will fall back to horizontal sync edge locking only. If the SCH error is higher than 50º, or the colorburst cannot be measured, the unit will report that the reference is unlockable. See section 4.1.2 for details on the Inputs status screen. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-20 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION When the 5700MSC-IP is provided with a PAL reference, the AES/DARS outputs can be deterministically phase aligned. This is because an even number of AES samples are generated during each frame of the PAL reference. Exactly 1920 AES frames fit into a single PAL frame. The AES/DARS/WC lck menu item should be set to PAL/integer to assure that the AES/DARS outputs are anchored to the PAL reference. Because the AES signal coincides with the PAL signal on every frame, the phase of the AES/DARS outputs will be the same between multiple 5700MSC units that are locked to PAL. In addition, the AES block length of 192 frames is evenly divisible into a single PAL frame so the start of an AES block (identified by the Z preamble) will correctly align to line 1 of the PAL reference (as illustrated in lock diagram #3 of Figure 2-9). A PAL reference provides enough information for phasing of 50Hz and 25Hz standards, but does not provide a long enough phase period to deterministically phase 60Hz or 24Hz standards. The standards that can be phased properly are listed at the bottom of lock diagram #3 (Figure 2-9). The HD standards listed apply to both the HD test generators and the tri-level sync outputs. The serial digital video test generator outputs are phased according to SMPTE compliant timing, which may differ from the timing shown on Tektronix equipment. See the note in section 2.2.6. If the PAL reference is lost, the unit will freerun on the selected oscillator as described in section 2.2.3. Note that if the Genlock Range is set to Wide, the freerun drift upon loss of reference will be much higher. When the PAL reference is regained, the Lock Type menu selection controls how the 5700MSC-IP will respond to re-align its internal oscillator with the reference (see section 2.2.4). 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-21 2.2.10.

The main oscillator frequency is locked to the rising edge of the tri-level waveform. The phase information provided by tri-level reference signals is limited and each signal standard can only be used to deterministically phase lock standards of a similar frame rate. Lock diagram #4 above gives an example for 1080i/59.94 tri-level sync. Refer to Table 2-5 for a summary on the phase locking capability with other tri-level references. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-22 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION It should be noted that tri-level references do not supply enough phase information to color frame NTSC-M or PAL-B sync outputs. When multiple 5700MSC-IP units are locked to a tri-level source, the black burst outputs from either unit cannot be guaranteed to have the same color frame phase. As such, the subcarrier outputs of the two units may also not be in phase with each other. For tri-level sync standards that run at a fractional rate (i.e. 1080i/59.94, 720p/59.94) the AES, DARS, and Wordclock output cannot be deterministically phase locked. This is because only one frame of phase information is provided by the tri-level reference. For these standards, the AES/DARS, and Wordclock output cannot be guaranteed to be the same phase between different units, or that the phase will remain the same if the 5700MSC-IP is restarted.

Slo-PAL Genlock The 5700MSC-IP supports two Slo-PAL references to provide an ability to lock film-rate standards while using a common analog sync format (PAL). The two standards supported are 625i/48 for use with 24Hz film standards and 625i/47.95 for use with 23.98Hz film standards. With Slo-PAL references, the 5700MSC-IP locks its frequency to the horizontal sync edges and uses the vertical sync for phasing. See Table 2-6 for phasing ability of each reference type. With a Slo-PAL reference, the AES/DARS outputs can be properly phase aligned since the number of AES samples (48,000 per second) is evenly divisible by Slo-PAL frame rates. There are exactly 2,000 AES samples generated for each frame of 48Hz Slo-PAL. Exactly 2,002 AES samples are generated for each frame of 47.95Hz Slo-PAL. Note that a 47.95Hz Slo-PAL reference does not provide enough phasing information to deterministically lock the 6/1.001Hz pulse output. When multiple 5700MSC-IP units are referenced to a 47.95Hz Slo-PAL signal, the 6/1.001Hz pulse outputs are not guaranteed to be lined up.

These signals are applied to the reference input BNCs and the frequency is automatically detected by the 5700MSC-IP. With CW signals, the main oscillator frequency is locked to the incoming reference but absolutely no phasing information is supplied. The 5700MSC-IP will arbitrarily pick an internal phase reference point once frequency lock is obtained. Lock diagram #5 (Figure 2-11) illustrates the generation of signals when locked to a reference that provides no phasing information. While outputs of the same standard will be phased correctly to each other, they will not be phased deterministically. The outputs of multiple units locked to a CW reference cannot be guaranteed to be in phase. Furthermore, if the 5700MSC-IP unit is restarted the phase relationships can change as a new phasing point is chosen. Likewise if the CW reference is lost, any drift accumulated during the time the reference is absent cannot be corrected for once the reference is regained. In order to align the output phase of two 5700MSC-IP units that are locked to a stable CW reference, the Ten MHz Global Phase controls can be used. See section 2.1.4 for more information. When the Ten MHz Global Phase is enabled, the 5700MSC-IP outputs can be phased manually to align them with another source. In this configuration, the unit will maintain a stable phase relationship as long as the CW reference is uninterrupted and the unit is not restarted. If a restart does occur, the 10MHz Global Phase controls are automatically disabled and reset to zero at startup. When a CW reference is used, the phase of the DARS and AES outputs can be anchored to either NTSC or PAL standards. This is chosen using the AES/DARS/WC lck menu item in the AES Audio menu. This menu item should be set to the dominant video standard that will be used in the particular installation. When the CW reference is lost, the 5700MSC-IP will free-run on its active oscillator, selected by the Genlock Range menu item (see section 4.3.2). The Lock type menu item controls how the 5700MSC-IP responds when the reference is regained (see section 2.2.4). 2.2.12.1.Internal Frequency Reference When Internal Ref is selected for the frequency reference, the 5700MSC-IP will free-run on the 10MHz output of its high-stability OCXO oscillator, regardless of the Genlock Range menu item setting. The locking operation is similar to when locking to CW signals. The 5700MSC-IP will pick an arbitrary phase reference to generate all outputs. This phase reference will be different between multiple 5700MSC-IP units set to free-run, and will change if the unit is restarted. The output phase of a 5700MSC-IP that is running off its internal reference can be adjusted by using the Internal Global Phase controls. When enabled, these controls will allow for temporarily bringing a free-running 5700MSC-IP into phase with another piece of equipment. Although the internal oscillator of a 5700MSC-IP is very stable, it will inevitably drift away from another reference due to the slight variation in frequency of its internal oscillator. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-25 2.2.13.

The main oscillator frequency is locked to the 1 pulse per second (PPS) timing pulse provided by the receiver. Because of the low rate of this timing pulse, only the high-stability OCXO oscillator can be used and the Genlock Range control will be forced to Narrow regardless of the menu setting. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-26 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION The GNSS receiver also provides highly accurate time. The 5700MSC-IP uses the time information to set the phase of all outputs. This is done by choosing a moment in GNSS time when all standards started at their initial phase. By working backwards to that moment, the instantaneous phase of any standard can be determined for any point in time. This allows true deterministic cross-standard phasing. See Figure 2-12 for the timing relationship between multiple standards when locked to GNSS.  Because the 5700MSC-IP uses GNSS time to determine the phase of the outputs, the time reference will be forced to use GNSS, regardless of the time Reference Src menu item setting. Using GNSS as a frequency reference is the only way to guarantee that all outputs across multiple standards will be phased to each other across multiple units. Furthermore, when two 5700MSC-IP units are separated by a large distance, using GNSS receivers can assure they will be phased to within 100ns of each other. Note than when using multiple units the antenna cable lengths should be matched as closely as possible to eliminate any cable length propagation delay effects that may cause phase errors between them. If the GNSS receiver is unplugged, or if the number of satellite signals being received drops to 0, the 5700MSC-IP will free-run on its high stability OCXO. The Lock type menu item controls how the unit will respond when the GNSS signal is restored (see section 2.5.3). When the unit first starts up, the phase of its outputs are random until GNSS lock is acquired. Refer to section 2.5.2 for more information on how the 5700MSC-IP locks when using the GNSS receiver as a reference. While GNSS provides a convenient way to lock the 5700MSC-IP in all standards simultaneously and ensure extremely good frequency accuracy, there can be issues dealing with limited availability and phase errors. A GNSS reference can be described as a “soft” lock. As more satellite signals are discovered, the phase accuracy of the GNSS lock improves. However, there will always be some “wander” associated with GNSS lock due to uncontrolled variables such as atmospheric disturbances and terrestrial interference. This can cause problems when two different units are locked to separate GNSS receivers. Under ideal conditions, with 8 satellite signals being received, the maximum wander in phase between two units locked to two separate GNSS antennas can be up to 15ns. This is greater than the duration of a single sample of serial digital HD video which may cause problems for router installations that require sample-accurate timing. During poor weather conditions, the satellite signal strength will drop which will cause fewer satellite signals to be available for phase corrections. This is why mounting of the GNSS receiver is extremely critical in order to get the best phase locking performance. If the receiver does not have a clear view of the sky or is subject to multipath interference due to reflections off buildings, the phase wander between units can quickly climb to unacceptable levels. The unpredictability of such variations can be difficult to troubleshoot so these characteristics must be taken into account during the design phase of any system. 2.3. Timekeeping The 5700MSC-IP contains a system clock to keep track of time and date. The stability of this clock is equal to the selected frequency reference. The accuracy of this clock is determined by the selected time reference and lock mode. The 5700MSC-IP can access time references through the GNSS receiver to another 5700MSC-IP, SNTP, or VITC read from a black burst reference. See section 2.3.3. The system clock should always be set to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). See section 2.3.2 for a note on UTC. Time zone offsets can be applied to the timecode outputs to provide local time. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-27 The system clock is synchronized to the selected time reference by performing a time jam. This is different than the continuous PLL process that is used for frequency references. The system clock in the 5700MSC-IP runs independently at the frequency provided by the master oscillator. Ideally, once the system clock has been set, it should keep perfect time forever. In practice stability errors, however slight, creep in and accumulate over time. Even when locked to GPS or an atomic frequency standard, leap seconds will occur in UTC time requiring the system clock to be occasionally adjusted. The 5700MSC-IP has several timecode outputs, each of which possess their own clock that runs independently from the system clock. The LTC outputs and each sync output (including 10MHz and Wordclock) and test generator outputs have their own independent clock. The timecode clocks are synchronized to the system clock once a day at user specified times. This allows for timecode rates that do not count in real-time. Note that NTP and IRIG time is derived directly from the system clock. The system clock time/date is constantly compared to the time/date that is provided by the selected time reference. Whenever a significant difference is detected, a system time jam will be required to bring the system clock back into sync with the time reference. A system time jam effectively jams the time and date acquired from the time reference into the system clock. This effect ripples to all timecode output clocks jamming them as well. Exactly when a system time jam is allowed to take place is determined by the Lock Type that is selected. The amount of difference between the system clock and the time reference must exceed a certain threshold before a system time jam is declared necessary. This threshold is different for each time reference type. 2.3.1. Time Lock Types The 5700MSC-IP system clock runs independently from the time reference. When a difference that exceeds the threshold is detected between the system clock and the time reference, a time jam is required to set the system clock to the time reference. How and when such a jam occurs is configured by the Lock Type menu item located in the Time menu off the INPUT root menu. The three jam modes are shown below with detailed descriptions. Always - Whenever the system clock is different than the time reference, a jam will automatically be performed. In this mode, the system clock will continuously track the time reference. Any change in the time reference will immediately affect all timecode clocks. This mode is most useful when the time reference is known to be reliable and stable such as with GPS. Never - In this mode, the time comparator is effectively shut off and the system clock will run independently from the time reference. No jam warnings will be generated. It is still possible to synchronize the system clock to the time reference by performing a manual time jam. This mode is useful when a time reference is not being used or is not always available. User - When the time comparator detects a difference between the system clock and the time reference, it will notify the operator with a jam warning. The message “TIME JAM NEEDED” will be displayed on the front panel, and optionally an SNMP trap can be sent. The operator can then decide if and when to perform a jam in order to cause minimum disruption to systems. This mode should be selected when the time outputs of the 5700MSC-IP require absolute minimum disruptions. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-28 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION Daily - The time comparator is shut off in this mode. A jam will be performed once a day at the time specified by the Input Jam Time control. This way the system clock can be brought into sync with the reference regularly, at time of day when any disruptions would go unnoticed.  When the Time Reference is set to SNTP, the Time Lock Type is forced to Daily.  A manual time jam can be initiated using the Jam Time menu item. When a time jam is performed, all timecode clocks are also jammed. Exercise caution before initiating a jam. 2.3.2. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is used worldwide as the basis of civil time and runs at the same rate as International Atomic Time (TAI). Unlike atomic time, Coordinated Universal Time is kept within one second of mean solar time, or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The rotation of the earth is very slightly slowing which causes the solar day to lengthen by a fraction of a second. This introduces a slight error between atomic time and solar time. Over weeks, months, and years, the error can add up until atomic time is a full second ahead of solar time. Because UTC runs at the same rate as atomic time, it must be slowed down if it is to match solar time. Leap seconds are introduced periodically and cause UTC clocks to count one extra second in a day to slow them down. The rotation of the earth is unpredictable which means the need for a leap second cannot be predicted more than six months in advance. If a leap second is necessary, it will occur at the end of the day usually on either June 30th, or December 31st. Refer to www.iers.org for more information and bulletins on upcoming leap seconds. Leap seconds can cause complications with 25Hz LTC or PAL VITC. See the timecode note in section 2.3.4.2.3 for more information. The 5700MSC-IP expects that the time reference provides UTC time. This is a requirement for the NTP server or modem hosting using the NRC protocol. When either of these options are utilized, the time reference source must provide UTC time. 2.3.3. Time Reference Sources The system clock can be referenced in one of several ways. The reference type is selected in the Time menu located in the INPUT root menu. The Reference Src menu item is used to select between GPS, LTC, VITC, IRIG, SNTP and None. See sections 2.3.3.1 to 2.3.3.6 for detailed descriptions of each time reference type. Note that the time reference will be forced to GPS if the frequency reference has been set to GPS, no matter what has been selected here. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-29 2.3.3.1.GPS Time Reference When GPS is selected as the time reference, time and date are obtained from the GPS receiver that is connected to the 5700MSC-IP. The GPS time provided by the receiver is then converted to UTC time by adding leap seconds. This time reference is extremely accurate and once the system clock has been jammed to the GPS receiver, it should remain in sync for a very long time without requiring further jams, provided the selected frequency reference is also accurate. Of all the time reference sources, GPS is the most accurate and reliable. When a difference of greater than 2 milliseconds is detected between the system clock and the time from the GPS receiver, the 5700MSC-IP will generate a jam event or jam warning, depending on the Lock Type setting. Such a difference can be caused by accumulated stability errors or by the introduction of a leap second. For information on installing the GPS receiver and a detailed description of its operation see section 2.5.2.  When the frequency reference has been set to GPS, the time reference is also forced to GPS. 2.3.3.2.LTC Time Reference The 5700MSC-IP+AUX can obtain time and date from an LTC input present on the GPIO DB15 connector. See section 3.1.6 for wiring information. All output frame rates in Table 2-7 are supported as references. Note that non real-time rates such as 23.98 and 29.97 nondropframe should be used with caution. See section 2.3.4.1 for information on using dropframe timecode and the considerations required. Date information can be decoded from the user bits (binary groups) of the LTC input. There are several date formats in use and the date decoding method can be selected using the VitcLtc Date menu item. Automatic detection of the date format is reliable for Legacy and SMPTE formats but may not work well for Production date formats. If the user bits of the incoming LTC are not defined, or do not contain date information the date decoder must be disabled (put into No date mode) to prevent false date decoding and spurious jam events. When date decoding is disabled, the date can be set manually using the Set System Date menu item located in the GENERAL root menu. The 5700MSC-IP+AUX will continuously compare the system clock to the incoming LTC time and date. When a difference of more than 2 milliseconds is detected the 5700MSC-IP+AUX will generate a jam event, or a jam warning depending on the Lock Type setting. When a jam event occurs, the time read from the LTC input is jammed into the system clock. At the same time, the LTC input time is jammed into the timecode output clocks. When the incoming LTC is jammed into a particular output timecode clock, it may be adjusted to maintain color frame alignment and to match the output frame rate. See section 2.3.4.2 for more information. If a particular timecode output is the same frame rate as the incoming LTC, the time is copied directly into the output‟s clock. If the timecode output is running at a different frame rate than the LTC input, then the time is rounded to the nearest frame before being jammed into the output‟s timecode clock. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-30 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION 2.3.3.3.VITC Time Reference The 5700MSC-IP can read Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC) from a SMPTE ST 318 compliant color black signal that is applied to the reference loop input. The VITC can be on any line of the incoming color black video from line 6 to line 31. The VITC reader line is set by the Vitc Line menu item. The 5700MSC-IP can read 25Hz VITC extracted from a PAL-B reference signal, and 29.97Hz dropframe VITC extracted from an NTSC-M reference signal. See section 2.3.4.2 for information on using dropframe timecode. Date information can be decoded from the user bits of the VITC. The date format is selected using the VitcLtc Date menu item. The automatic detection mode works well for Legacy and SMPTE formats, but may not work reliably for Production date formats. If there is no date information on the incoming VITC or if the user bits are being used for another purpose, the date decoder must be disabled by setting it to No Date. This prevents false date decoding that may trigger spurious time jam events or warnings. When the date decoder is disabled, the date can be manually set using the Set System Date menu item in the GENERAL root menu. The 5700MSC-IP will continuously compare the system clock to the incoming VITC timecode. When a difference of more than 2 milliseconds is detected the 5700MSC-IP will generate a jam event, or a jam warning depending on the Lock Type setting. When a jam event occurs, the time read from the VITC input is jammed into the system clock. At the same time, the VITC input time is jammed into the timecode output clocks. When the incoming VITC is jammed into a particular output timecode clock, it may be adjusted to maintain color frame alignment and to match the output frame rate. See section 2.3.4.2 for more information. If a particular timecode output is the same frame rate as the incoming VITC, the time is copied directly into the output‟s clock. If the timecode output is running at a different frame rate than the VITC input, then the time is rounded to the nearest frame before being jammed into the output‟s timecode clock.  In order to use VITC as a time reference, the frequency reference must be set to Video. 2.3.3.4.IRIG Time Reference When the IRIG option is installed, the 5700MSC-IP+AUX will be able to read IRIG-B timecode that is applied to the LTC input on the GPIO connector. The IRIG type is auto-detected. Refer to section 2.3.5 for more information on the IRIG-B formats supported and how to connect IRIG to the LTC input. Only the IRIG-B124 and IRIG-B127 formats supply complete date information. If other formats are used, the system date will have to be set manually using the Set System Date menu item in the GENERAL root menu. The system clock is continuously compared with the incoming IRIG timecode. When a difference of more than 5.5 milliseconds is detected the 5700MSC-IP+AUX will flag that a time jam is required. The time Lock Type menu item controls how the 5700MSC-IP+AUX responds when a time jam is needed. See section 2.3.1 for more information. 2.3.3.5.SNTP Time Reference The 5700MSC-IP can jam its system clock to an external NTP server. Unlike with other time references, this synchronization is not continuous and happens once a day. The time Lock Type is 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-31 forced to Daily, and the Input Jam Time control sets the time of day the synchronization happens. Up to eight external NTP servers can be defined. All enabled NTP servers will be contacted and the server response with the best stratum and dispersion values will be chosen to jam the system clock. 2.3.3.6.No Time Reference When the time reference source is set to None, the 5700MSC-IP will ignore all time reference sources and the system clock will freerun. The time and date must be set manually using the Set System Time and Set System Date menu items located in the GENERAL root menu. It is recommended to set the system clock time to UTC rather than to local time. Local time can then be specified using a time zone offset from UTC on the timecode outputs. The “eyeball and wristwatch” method of setting the system clock cannot be considered accurate time. The NTP server will report an unlocked condition (LI_Alarm) unless spoofing is enabled. See section 2.4 for more information. 2.3.4. LTC and VITC Timecode The primary purpose of LTC and VITC timecode is to count frames. Each LTC count relates to one frame of video. The Linear Time Code output waveforms are aligned to video so that the end of the sync word lines up with the start of the field1 vertical sync. This occurs on line 4 for the NTSC standard, and line 1 for the PAL standard. Vertical Interval Time Code can be inserted onto any black burst sync output and is inserted onto a vertical blanking line once per field, twice per frame. See Figure 2-13 for LTC and VITC timing relationships. Note that VITC is inserted once per field allowing VITC timecode to count fields. LTC timecode has one count per frame and does not count fields. End of LTC Sync Word NTSC Line 4 VITC Line 14 0 1 Field 1 Figure 2-13: Detail of 29.97Hz LTC Waveform Alignment to NTSC Video The LTC/VITC timecode rates supported by the 5700MSC-IP are summarized in Table 2-7. All of these rates maintain alignment to their respective video standards. When VITC is inserted onto a PAL black burst sync output, it runs at 25Hz. When VITC is inserted onto an NTSC black burst sync output it runs at 29.97Hz. In addition to video alignment, the LTC and VITC timecode for the 25Hz and 29.97Hz rates can be adjusted to maintain color frame alignment as per SMPTE ST 12-1. Refer to section 2.3.4.2 for more information on how color frame alignment is performed.

The LTC rates of 24Hz and 30Hz run at real-time and do not suffer from color frame alignment rules. They take exactly one second to reach their full count of either 24 or 30 frames. The 25Hz rate also runs at real-time but may be adjusted to maintain color frame alignment to PAL video (see section 2.3.4.2.3 for the implications of this). The 23.98Hz and 29.97Hz rates run slightly slower than real-time. They take slightly longer than one second (1.001 seconds) to count a full second worth of frames. This means that every minute they will lag behind real-time by 0.06 seconds. Every hour they will be behind 3.6 seconds. After a 24-hour period they will be 86.4 seconds behind real-time. These rates are unsuitable for timekeeping purposes. They are only useful for counting frames. 2.3.4.1.Dropframe Counting Because the 29.97Hz rate is used extensively as timecode for video reference signals, a method was developed to allow reasonably precise time keeping with the non real-time rate. This method involves dropframe counting. Since the 29.97Hz rate runs slower than real-time, dropframe counting skips over certain frame counts in order to periodically catch up to real time. Frame counts are always skipped over in pairs so as not to disrupt any color frame alignment. Two frame counts are skipped over at the beginning of every minute, except minutes 00, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50. This pattern can be seen in Figure 2-14. Dropframe counting ensures that 29.97Hz timecode accumulates just 86.4 milliseconds of error per day and always stays within 200 milliseconds of real-time. Figure 2-15 illustrates the drift and catch-up cycle that dropframe counting goes through over the course of a day. Real-time is represented by the solid X- axis in the graphs. See section 2.3.4.2.2 for information on synchronizing multiple dropframe timecode outputs. To maintain a long-term correlation to real time, all LTC and VITC timecode outputs are jammed to the system clock once per day. This limits the amount of accumulated error for non real-time rates. Daily jamming is also required for real-time rates to prevent accumulation of stability errors and to keep synchronized should a leap second occur. The time at which this daily jam occurs is controlled by the Jam Time menu item present in all LTC and sync output menus. The daily jam should be scheduled to occur at a time when it would be least likely to affect system operation. The timecode clock will jam when the LTC or VITC timecode count matches the Jam Time value. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-33 Figure 2-14: Dropframe Timecode with Respect to Real-time Over 1-Hour Period Figure 2-15: Dropframe Timecode with Respect to Real-time over a 24-Hour Period 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-34 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION 2.3.4.2.LTC/VITC Timecode Color Framing If the Color Frame control is turned on, the 25Hz and 29.97Hz LTC timecode rates will have their counts adjusted by the 5700MSC-IP so that they maintain color frame alignment to the selected frequency reference as per SMPTE ST 12-1. If a black burst sync output has its Color Frame control turned on, the VITC timecode is adjusted to same way to maintain color frame alignment to that particular black burst sync output. See the pulse diagrams in Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4 for examples of timecode color frame alignment. 2.3.4.2.1.Color Frame Alignment to NTSC Color frame alignment can be enabled for any NTSC sync output and for LTC timecode that runs at 29.97 frames per second. Even frame counts must coincide with color fields 1 and 2. Odd frame counts must coincide with color fields 3 and 4. When a system time jam event occurs, the timecode output clock is jammed to system time and then adjusted, if necessary, to match the color frame phase of the particular LTC or sync output. The consequence of color frame alignment is that the LTC/VITC timecode may be jammed one frame count off of real-time, depending on the phase of the frequency reference and the phase of the LTC or sync output. See Figure 2-16 for an example of daily time jamming involving dropframe timecode. 2.3.4.2.2.Multiple LTC/VITC Outputs with Dropframe Counting It should be evident that dropframe timecode maintains only a loose correlation to real-time, and cannot always be jammed exactly to real-time. Dropframe timecode counts an entire 24-hour period 86.4 milliseconds faster than real-time. This is the equivalent of 2.59 frames of video. At the daily jam event, when the timecode clock is jammed to the system clock, some extra frame counts will have to be inserted to bring the timecode closer to real-time. It is not possible to adjust by fractional frame counts. Either 2 or 3 frame counts must be added, which means the timecode output cannot be jammed exactly to the system clock and some error will occur. If color frame alignment is enabled, the extra frame counts can only be inserted in pairs. Therefore, 2 or 4 frame counts will be inserted, depending on the error accumulated from the previous daily jam. See Figure 2-16 for an example of a daily jam event for LTC1 in 29.97Hz dropframe counting mode. When the timecode of LTC1 hits the daily jam time, a jam to the real-time system clock is performed. However, the number of extra counts inserted is adjusted to maintain color frame alignment to the frequency reference (either GPS or NTSC). If the timecode output was VITC, the adjustment would also have to factor in any phase offset that may have been applied to the respective sync output.

The amount of frames adjusted depends on the error accumulated from the previous daily time jam. See Figure 2-17 for an example of a week worth of daily time jams on a dropframe 29.97Hz timecode output. The pattern of 2 frame and 4 frame adjustments runs over a period of a couple months. If multiple timecode outputs are set to dropframe counting mode, it is possible that they may jam differently from each other at the daily time jam event, even if they are set to jam at the exact same time. This can occur if they were initialized at different times. To prevent this from happening, use the “Jam all VitcLtc” menu item which forces all timecode outputs to jam at the same instant. This manual jam is typically done at an innocuous time of day. There is currently no method of forcing multiple units to jam together at the same time. It can be expected that eventually a 2-frame offset may appear between dropframe timecode across multiple 5700MSC-IP units. Figure 2-17: Dropframe Timecode with Respect to Real-time over One Week 2.3.4.2.3.Color Frame Alignment to PAL Color frame alignment to PAL video can be enabled for 25Hz LTC timecode and for any PAL sync (VITC) output or PAL analog TG output (burn-in window). The 25Hz timecode runs at exactly real time which means it is always possible to jam the timecode output exactly to the system clock. However, the color frame alignment rule adds additional complexity. The color frame sequence in PAL runs over 4 frames (8 fields), which does not divide evenly into a 25 frame per second count. This means that color frame 1 lines up with the same frame count only once every four seconds. Therefore color frame alignment occurs once every 4 seconds. When a time jam event occurs, the timecode output clock is jammed to the system clock and then may be adjusted up or down one or two frame counts to match the color frame phase of the reference or particular black burst sync output. If the frequency reference to the 5700MSC-IP is not phased correctly with respect to the time reference this can cause a static one or two frame shift for 25Hz timecode outputs, with respect to the system clock. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-36 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION If the frequency reference of the 5700MSC-IP is set to GNSS, the time reference will also be forced to GNSS. The system phase reference is derived from GNSS time, but the system clock is set to UTC time, which is offset from GNSS time by the total number of leap seconds that have occurred since the year 1980. Because the PAL color frame to timecode relationship runs over 4 seconds, this produces a unique problem when aligning UTC-locked timecode to the PAL color frame. The system clock of the 5700MSC-IP is always set to UTC time. The PAL reference phase is tied to GNSS time which is not affected by leap seconds. Whenever a leap second occurs, UTC time counts an extra second, slowing it down. At the next jam event, the PAL timecode clock could jam to the system clock causing it to shift backwards by one second. If done this way, it would break the timecode to color frame relationship. However, the 5700MSC-IP must adjust the time that is jammed into the 25Hz LTC/VITC clocks in order to maintain color frame alignment. This means is that a static, positive or negative, 1 or 2 frame offset may be introduced between real time and 25Hz timecode even when the 5700MSC-IP is locked to GPS. This static offset will change every time a leap second occurs. 2.3.5. IRIG Timecode When equipped with the IRIG option, the 5700MSC-IP is capable of generating IRIG-B timecode from the LTC outputs and can also read IRIG-B timecode on the LTC input. The IRIG-B formats supported are shown in Table 2-8. All IRIG-B formats are based on 100-bit timecode that is amplitude modulated with a 1kHz sine wave carrier. The differences between the four formats are in what additional information is carried besides the Time-of-Year timestamp. All control flag bits, if present, are set to zero. Format Name Information Carried IRIG-B120 Time-of-Year, Control Flags, Straight Binary Seconds IRIG-B122 Time-of-Year IRIG-B123 Time-of-Year, Straight Binary Seconds IRIG-B124 Time-of-Year, Year, Control Flags, Straight Binary Seconds IRIG-B127 Time-of-Year, Year, Straight Binary Seconds Table 2-8: Supported IRIG Timecode Formats The IRIG-B outputs are aligned to the IRIG Datum pulse as shown in Figure 2-18. For an overall view of the entire IRIG waveform, refer to Figure 2-1. The output waveform consists of a 1kHz carrier that is amplitude modulated to the IRIG pulse waveform. The frame reference bit (PR) leading edge coincides with the IRIG Datum pulse output from the 5700MSC-IP. When locked to GPS, IRIG will be aligned within 20 microseconds of the 1pps pulse from the GPS receiver (with no global phase offset). 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-37 Position Identifier P0 Reference Bit PR IRIG-B12X - Modulated 1kHz Carrier IRIG1 Datum Pulse Figure 2-18: Detail of IRIG Alignment to IRIG Datum Pulse Depending on the IRIG format selected, different types of information may be placed in the IRIG frame. The Time-of-Year portion is always present and indicates the current system clock time in seconds, minutes, hours, and day of the year. The IRIG-B120, IRIG-B123, and IRIG-B127 formats include a straight binary seconds counter which gives the current time of day in seconds. The IRIG-B127 format also includes the current year as a two-digit number (e.g. 2011 = 11). The IRIG timecode is generated directly from the system clock, which should be set to UTC. The LTC outputs (with the 5700MSC-IP+AUX option) can be configured to one of the four IRIG formats in their respective menus. The IRIG signal amplitude can be controlled by the Output Level menu item. When an LTC output has been configured to an IRIG output mode, both primary and secondary outputs will provide the same IRIG signal. The 5700MSC-IP can also be configured to the IRIG-B as a time reference. The time reference source must first be set to IRIG. See section 4.3.4 for information on configuring the time reference source. The Irig Mode menu item selects which IRIG format to use as a reference and can also enable auto detection. Only IRIG-B127 can provide full date information. Both IRIG input and output circuitry is balanced. To connect an unbalanced IRIG source to the LTC input, or to use the LTC outputs to drive an unbalanced IRIG cable. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-38 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION 2.4. Network Time Protocol (NTP) If the 5700MSC-IP has an available Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. The NTP server runs on the CONTROL Ethernet port using the IP address assigned to the port. The NTP features are configured in the NTP Rules menu located in the GENERAL root menu. The 5700MSC-IP implements version 3 of the NTP protocol as defined in RFC 1305. The NTP server uses the system clock as its source of time. This requires the system clock to be set to UTC in order to generate a valid NTP timestamp. The contents of the packets are largely determined by the chosen time reference and the lock status. If the 5700MSC-IP is not locked to the selected time reference, the LI_Alarm flag in all outgoing NTP packets will be set. This informs clients that the NTP reference clock in the 5700MSC-IP is not locked to a reference. This flag is also set when the time reference is set to None. When this flag is set, most clients will reject the time packet provided by the 5700MSC-IP. This flag can be deactivated by enabling NTP spoofing. NTP spoofing should only be used for testing and troubleshooting purposes as it technically breaks compliance with the NTP standard. When an incoming client request for NTP time is received by the 5700MSC-IP, the source IP address is checked against a list of NTP restrictions. There are a total of eight restrictions and they are checked sequentially. If the incoming request passes all eight restrictions, the NTP server will respond. It is possible to perform a quick validation of NTP operation using a Windows XP or Windows 2000 PC that is connected to the same network as the 5700MSC-IP. For Windows XP Home edition, right-click on the time display of the taskbar and select Adjust Date/Time. This will open up the Date and Time control panel. There should be three tabs at the top: “Date & Time”, “Time Zone” and “Internet Time”. If the “Internet Time” tab does not exist, use the command-line method below. Enter the IP address of the 5700MSC-IP into the Server text box and click on the “Update Now” button. If the PC communicates with the 5700MSC-IP NTP server, the time should update successfully. Another method is to use the “w32tm” utility from the command prompt. It may be necessary to install the Windows Time Service before this command will be available. Open a command prompt window by going to START->Programs->Accessories or by going to START->Run and typing in “cmd”. Enter the command “w32tm /monitor /computers:172.21.1.56”. In this case 172.21.1.56 is the IP address of the 5700MSC-IP. Figure 2-19: Testing the NTP Server In the example above, the NTP server in the 5700MSC-IP at 172.21.1.56 was successfully contacted. The PC clock is 35 seconds advanced from the time provided by the 5700MSC-IP. The RefID indicates that the 5700MSC-IP is locked to GPS time.

Global Navigation Satellite System The 5700MSC-IP can be both frequency and time locked to the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). The following section describes the basics of the GNSS system and the operation of the 5700MSC-IP when it is locking to the GNSS satellites. 2.5.1. Overview The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite based navigation system operated and maintained by the U.S. Department of Defence. There are currently 32 satellites in orbit providing worldwide 24 hour coverage. Presently GPS is the most accurate technology available for marine and land navigation and it is the technology of choice in timing applications including remote site and network synchronization. Each GPS satellite Space Vehicle (SV) contains four onboard atomic clocks. These clocks are averaged and are used to transmit GPS time, along with the positions of all satellites (the almanac) and fine tracking data (the ephemeris). To acquire GPS time, the receiver only needs to track one satellite. The position of the satellite is known and the transmission delay can be subtracted to obtain GPS time with millisecond accuracy. In order to obtain a three-dimensional position, the ranges from multiple satellites must be compared. If the receiver had perfect timing, three satellite ranges would be sufficient to calculate a position. In real- world applications, the clock in the receiver will not be an atomic clock and the smallest error in frequency will cause huge errors in positioning. Consequently, a fourth satellite range is incorporated to solve for timing error in the receiver. This allows the receiver to correct its clock and synchronize it to within nanoseconds of the GPS constellation. The 5700MSC-IP is more involved with this clock correction/synchronization feature of the GPS process than it is with the positioning aspect. 2.5.2. GNSS Lock Operation The GNSS receiver is a Trimble Acutime 360 which is designed for maximum accuracy in static (antenna not moving) mounting applications. The receiver will also function when mobile with decreased precision. When the GNSS receiver is first connected, it will try to track satellite signals using its stored almanac. The status display will report “GNSS Searching” during this initialization stage. If the receiver has been powered off for a while, or has been moved a significant distance, it may need to download a new almanac. This can require up to 15 minutes of continuously tracking a satellite to complete. It should be noted here that when GNSS is being used for a time reference only, contact with just a single satellite is enough to provide accurate time. A GNSS time reference will start working as soon as a single satellite is tracked. For frequency synchronization, a more complex process is involved. When the almanac is determined to be valid, the receiver will attempt to complete a self-survey. This is done by averaging up to 300 positional readings to obtain precise locational data for the antenna. This process can take up to 5 minutes. Obtaining a position requires the receiver to track at least four satellites. Satellites which do not meet the minimum quality criteria (elevation, signal strength, dilution of precision) cannot be used during a self-survey. The status display will read “GNSS Poor Signal” if four healthy satellite signals cannot be found. These requirements are more stringent when performing a self-survey than they are when in normal operation. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-40 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION When the self-survey is complete, the GNSS receiver will begin to send out a 1pps pulse to the 5700MSC-IP. The 5700MSC-IP will frequency-lock its ovenized oscillator to the pulse edges, and phase-lock to GNSS time. Once the GNSS receiver knows its precise location, it can substitute its position into the equation and solve only for clock error and clock bias. In this mode, it can operate with just one satellite and still provide accurate timing to the 5700MSC-IP. The status of the GNSS lock progress can be monitored in the Lock Status and Inputs status screens (see section 4.1.2). As more satellite signals are detected, the receiver will enter over determined clock mode. Up to 12 satellites can be tracked, using their signal strength and position in the sky to give them more or less weight in contributing to the solution. The quality criteria are more relaxed than when performing a self- survey and each available satellite will improve timing precision. If the receiver is moving, such as in a mobile application, the receiver will enter dynamic mode and still provide reasonably high precision. After the 5700MSC-IP has locked to the GNSS receiver and is in a steady state condition for longer than 20 minutes the master oscillator will be phase locked to within 15ns to 90ns of the GNSS system time reference, depending on the number of healthy satellites that are tracked. When using multiple 5700MSC-IP units referenced to GNSS, it is important to make sure both receivers are mounted equally so that they detect a similar number of satellites, and that the antenna cable lengths are matched as closely as possible to limit signal path propagation delays to match their phases as closely as possible. If the GNSS receiver is disconnected, the ovenized oscillator within the 5700MSC-IP may drift very slowly over time. The maximum frequency drift of the oscillator is less than 0.04Hz of subcarrier frequency after a day of the GPS receiver being disconnected. The drift will be less than 0.3Hz if the GPS receiver was disconnected or obscured from the sky for 1 year. 2.5.3. GNSS Re-Lock in Slow Mode When the frequency lock mode is set to Slow (see section 2.2.4), the 5700MSC-IP can provide a very smooth recovery of phase upon reconnection of the GNSS antenna. There will be a very smooth transition of the 5700MSC-IP‟s phase back to the GNSS system time reference. This transition is very gradual with no non-linear jumps. Because the phase period when locked to GNSS is very long (160 seconds – see Figure 2-12) this relock process can take a long time when the phase is considerably far off. The re-lock will take less then 40 minutes after an unspecified period of time (i.e. 1 year or more) of the GNSS receiver being disconnected or obscured from the sky. If the GNSS receiver is removed for 5 minutes and then returned, the unit will take nominally less then 5 minutes to fully re-lock. If the GNSS receiver is removed for 15 minutes and then returned, the unit will take nominally less than 20 minutes to fully phase-lock to the GNSS system time. 2.5.4. GNSS Position Insertion into Timecode The 5700MSC-IP can insert the current position of the GNSS antenna into the user bits of the LTC and VITC outputs. This is controlled by the VitcLtc dte fmt menu item in the GENERAL root menu. Timecode with even numbered frames contain longitude in the user bits, and timecode with odd numbered frames contain latitude. The format for latitude is wxxxyyzz where w is 1 for south (-), and 2 for north (+), xxx is degrees, yy is minutes, and zz is seconds. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System THEORY OF OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 2-41 The format for longitude is wxxxyyzz where w is 3 for west (-), and 4 for east (+), xxx is degrees, yy is minutes, and zz is seconds. For example, at the Evertz Microsystems factory, the data is latitude: 20432348 longitude: 30794623 This corresponds to: North (+) 043 degrees, 23.48 minutes West (-) 079 degrees, 46.23 minutes It can be entered into Google maps using the format “+43 23.48 -79 46.23”. 2.6. Automatic Changeover Operation For critical infrastructure requirements an automatic changeover unit can be used to connect two 5700MSC-IP units in a dual redundant configuration. The automatic changeover unit monitors signal health to decide which of the 5700MSC-IP units will be connected to the downstream outputs. The automatic changeover unit allows for a dual-redundant installation of two 5700MSC-IP units. Normally one of the 5700MSC-IP units is designated to the master, and its outputs are connected to the automatic changeover unit. The second 5700MSC-IP unit is designated as the slave (or backup), and its outputs are also connected to the automatic changeover unit. The automatic changeover unit then provides relay-protected outputs to feed downstream equipment. The automatic changeover unit can be switched manually (locally via front panel or remotely via SNMP), or can be put into automatic mode where the outputs will be switched to the slave unit if a problem is detected with the master. In order for a seamless switch to occur, both 5700MSC-IP units must be running at the same frequency and phase. Ideally, this is done by locking both units to the same reference. It is possible to lock the slave unit to the master but this reduces the protection offered by the automatic changeover unit should a problem develop with the master unit. Additionally, it is required that both 5700MSC-IP units are configured identically so that their outputs settings match. A syncro connection is automatically made inside the automatic changeover unit that allows the master unit to communicate its settings to the slave unit. The automatic changeover unit simplifies wiring by providing a single point of entry for an LTC reference, and GPIs for both 5700MSC-IP units. The LTC input to the automatic changeover unit is internally split to both master and slave units. Similarly, the GPI inputs are split to both units, allowing any GPI trigger to affect both units simultaneously. The automatic changeover unit uses latching relays to provide a fail-safe signal path. These relays will maintain their last state should the automatic changeover unit experience a power supply failure or main board failure. This ensures glitch-free failure events and glitch-free recovery from failure. All inputs from both 5700MSC-IP units are passively monitored by the automatic changeover unit. There are no active components in the signal path. This is accomplished by splitting a small portion of the incoming signal to the control/monitoring circuitry of the automatic changeover unit. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 2-42 Revision 0.1 THEORY OF OPERATION This page left intentionally blank 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System INSTALLATION Revision 0.1 Page 3-1 3. INSTALLATION 3.1. REAR PANEL Figure 3-1 provides an illustration of the 5700MSC-IP rear panel. The following sections describe the purpose of the rear panel connectors of the 5700MSC-IP. The following sections 3.1.1 to 3.1.12 describe the specific signals that should be connected to the 5700MSC-IP. Figure 3-1: 5700MSC-IP Rear Panel 3.1.1. Reference Loop Connections The two REF IN LOOP BNC connectors provide a reference loop input for black burst, tri-level, and 5MHz/10MHz signals. The BNCs are isolated from chassis ground. The frequency reference source must be set to Video in order to genlock to black burst or tri-level video signals. It must be set to 10MHz in order to lock to 5MHz or 10MHz reference signals. See section 4.3 for more information. The loop is high impedance and will need to be properly terminated with 75 ohms using an external termination. 3.1.2. Sync Outputs SYNC 1 to 6 - These BNC connectors provide six independent programmable sync outputs that are configured by the SYNC 1 to SYNC 6 group of sub-menus in the OUTPUT setup menu. The 5700MSC- IP+AUX provides two additional BNC connectors: SYNC 7 and SYNC 8. Each output can be configured for any format of sync output from black burst, to tri-level, to 5MHz/10MHz, to wordclock, and more. 10 MHz OUT (SYNC 7) - This BNC connector provides a 10MHz frequency reference but can also be programmed as another sync output. It is recommended that this output be configured as a 10MHz output when used in conjunction with an automatic changeover unit to simplify wiring. It is configured using the 10 MHz sub-menu in the OUTPUT setup menu. WORDCLOCK (SYNC 8) - This BNC connector provides a 48kHz wordclock signal but can also be programmed as another sync output. It is recommended that this output be configured as a wordclock 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 3-2 Revision 0.1 INSTALLATION output when used in conjunction with an automatic changeover unit to simplify wiring. It is configured using the Wordclock sub-menu in the OUTPUT setup menu. 3.1.3. Ethernet Connections The 5700MSC-IP is equipped with 5 interfaces, of which one is furnished through the 1G copper frame controller port (called the FP), two 1G copper ports on the rear plate, and two 10G SFP ports on the rear plate. All ports can do PTP, PCR, NTP, FTP and SNMP. Additionally, the two 10G SFP ports also provide three IP Test Generator signals. The 1G ports can be used with 10Base-T (10 Mbps),100Base- TX (100 Mbps) or 1000Base-TX (1000Mbps) twisted pair Ethernet cabling systems. When connecting for 10Base-T systems, category 3, 4, or 5 UTP cable as well as EIA/TIA – 568 100Ω STP cable may be used. When connecting for 100Base-TX systems, category 5 or better UTP cable is required. The cable must be “straight through” with an 8-pin modular connector at each end. Make the network connection by plugging one end of the cable into the CONTROL receptacle of the 5700MSC-IP and the other end into an Ethernet hub or switch. The CONTROL port hosts an NTP server (with periodic broadcasts) and an SNMP server for remote monitoring and control. The straight-through Ethernet cable can be purchased or can be constructed using the pinout information in Table 3-1. A color code wiring chart is provided in Table 3-1 for the current Ethernet standards (AT&T 258A or EIA/TIA 258B color coding shown). Also refer to the notes following the table for additional wiring guide information. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Pin # Signal EIA/TIA 568A AT&T 258A or EIA/TIA 568B 10BaseT or 100BaseTX 1000BaseT 1 Transmit + White/Green White/Orange X X 2 Transmit – Green Orange X X 3 Receive + White/Orange White/Green X X 4 Bi-Directional + Blue Blue Not used (required) X 5 Bi-Directional – White/Blue White/Blue Not used (required) X 6 Receive – Orange Green X X 7 Bi-Directional + White/Brown White/Brown Not used (required) X 8 Bi-Directional – Brown Brown Not used (required) X Table 3-1: Standard 8-pin Modular Connector Wiring Color Codes Note the following cabling information for this wiring guide:  Only two pairs of wires are used in the 8-pin modular connector to carry Ethernet signals for 10BaseT and 100BaseTX. 1000BaseT uses all four pairs.  Even though pins 4, 5, 7 and 8 are not used for 10BaseT and 100BaseTX, it is mandatory that they be present in the cable.  10BaseT and 100BaseTX use the same pins; the same crossover cable will work with both.  Pairs may be solid colors and may not have a stripe.  Category 5 cable must use Category 5 rated connectors. The maximum cable run between the 5700MSC-IP and the supporting switch is 328 ft (100 m). The maximum combined cable run between any two end points (i.e. 5700MSC-IP and PC/laptop via Ethernet switch) is 656 feet (200 m) when using copper cable. Devices on the Ethernet network continually monitor the receive data path for activity as a means of checking that the link is working correctly. When the network is idle, the devices also send a link test 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System INSTALLATION Revision 0.1 Page 3-3 signal to one another to verify link integrity. The 5700MSC-IP rear panel is fitted with two LEDs to monitor the Ethernet connection. 10/100/1000: This Amber LED is ON when a 100Base-TX link is detected. The LED is OFF when a 10Base-T link is detected. LN/ACT: This dual purpose Green LED will turn on to indicate a valid link. This gives a good indication that the segment is wired correctly. The LED will BLINK when sending or receiving data. The LED will be OFF if there is no valid connection. The link status can also be seen in the ControlEthernet status screen. 3.1.4. Serial Port Connection There are two serial ports provided, connections are accomplished by removing the front panel and using the Evertz standard rainbow cable. The COM connector is a 9-pin female 'D' connector for RS- 232 serial communications. This port is configured for a „straight through‟ RS-232 connection to a PC COM port and can be used for uploading firmware to the unit. Table 3-2 shows the pinout of the serial port in its default RS-232 DCE configuration. The connections are found at the front of the 7800MSC-IP card, to the left of the LED status display. The front-most connector (J24) is the traditional console COM port. Immediately behind the LED status display and to the right is the Front Panel Emulation port (J16), which allows a serial terminal with VT220 emulation to substitute for the front control panel on the 5700MSC-IP. Communication settings are 460,800 baud, no parity, 8 data bits and 1 stop bit.

Power Connections The 5700MSC-IP has one or two (redundant supply is optional: 5700MSC-IP+2PS) auto-ranging power supplies that operate on either 95-125 or 185-260 volts AC at 50Hz or 60Hz. Power should be applied by connecting a 3-wire grounding type power supply cord to the power entry modules on the rear panel. The power cord should be minimum 18 AWG wire size; type SVT marked VW-1, maximum 2.5 m in length. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 3-6 Revision 0.1 INSTALLATION The IEC 320 power entry modules combine a standard power inlet connector and an EMI line filter. CAUTION - TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ELECTRIC SHOCK, GROUNDING OF THE GROUND PIN OF THE MAINS PLUG MUST BE MAINTAINED  The EMI line filters in the 5700MSC-IP use the chassis ground as part of the circuit. This generates a small amount of AC leakage current to ground. In order to reduce risk of electric shock, the unit MUST be grounded properly through the ground connections on the AC power supply inlets. 3.1.13. M4 Grounding Stud The M4 grounding stud is used to provide a ground point to the 5700MSC-IP chassis. It is located under the REF IN LOOP connectors. It can be used for protective earthing in installations that require it. An M4 or #8 ring terminal can be used with the provided M4 nut and lock washer. 3.2. MOUNTING AND COOLING The 5700MSC-IP is equipped with rack mounting ears and fits into a standard 19 inch by 1 ¾ inch (483 mm x 45 mm) rack space. An optional rear support kit is available for rear mounting in a rack. The main board and power supplies are forced-air cooled by two fans in each power supply (or fan module). Both power supply slots must be occupied by a power supply or fan module at all times to ensure proper operating temperatures inside the unit. The air is drawn in through perforations along the edges of the front panel and exhausted out the sides of the unit. Ensure that the exhaust holes along the side of the unit are not blocked by rack supports or cabling otherwise the unit may overheat. A system fault is activated when the temperature inside the unit exceeds operating limits. 3.3. CONNECTING THE GENERAL PURPOSE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS The 15-pin female GPIO connector on the 5700MSC-IP+AUX has 2 general purpose inputs and 2 general purpose outputs. The GPI inputs are active low. This means that if an input is floating (not connected) then it will not be activated. The GPIs can be activated by connecting the GPI input pin to Ground using a button, switch, relay or an open collector transistor. The GPIs can be configured to send out SNMP traps on activation. The GPO outputs are internally pulled up to +5 volts DC. When a GPO activates, the GPO pin is pulled to ground. Care must be taken to limit the sink current to less than 50mA or damage to the GPO will result. The functions of the general purpose outputs are set using the GPO 1 Mode and GPO 2 Mode menu items on the GENERAL Setup menu. Note that in event of power being removed from the 5700MSC, the GPOs will appear to be a 20K sink to ground. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System INSTALLATION Revision 0.1 Page 3-7 3.4. CONNECTING TWO 5700MSC UNITS IN SYNCRO MODE When two 5700MSCs are connected in a redundant configuration with an automatic changeover unit, it is necessary that both 5700MSC units have the same timing and output settings. Identical timing for the 5700MSCs is assured by locking both to the same frequency and phase source (e.g. GNSS or by genlocking one unit to the other). Ensuring that both 5700MSCs have the same output configuration and time can be accomplished by implementing syncro between the two units. The syncro link is automatically made when the GPIO connector of both 5700MSC units is connected to the automatic changeover unit using male-to-male DB15 cables. Once the two units are connected, one must be designated the master unit and the other the slave. The slave unit will copy all the output menu settings from the master unit so that any change done on the master (such as changing a test pattern or phase offset) will also be applied to the slave. Additionally, the master 5700MSC can be used as a time reference by the slave unit, with the time and date being transmitted through the syncro link. To use syncro, the master 5700MSC must be set to one of the master syncro modes. Likewise, the slave 5700MSC must be set to a slave mode. When the master 5700MSC has been configured to send syncro information and the slave 5700MSC has been configured to receive it, the state of the link can be viewed on the slave unit by pressing the STATUS button and selecting the Inputs status screen. The slave unit will indicate Syncro link ok. When the link has been established, the slave unit can also set its time reference source to Syncro and will obtain time through the link as well as menu settings. See section 4.3.4 for details. When syncro menu mode is active, all of the menu settings in the OUTPUT root menu are copied from the master 5700MSC to the slave unit. The menu settings in the INPUT and GENERAL menus are not affected by syncro. In the OUTPUT menu the SDI TGs can be excluded from syncro. This can be done individually for each test generator. 3.5. GNSS RECEIVER INSTALLATION The 5700MSC-IP unit is designed to work with the Trimble Acutime 360 antenna. The Smart Antenna houses the GNSS receiver, antenna, power supply and other support circuitry in a sealed, shielded, self-contained unit with a digital interface to the main unit. The GNSS Smart Antenna also receives power from the main unit through the connection cable. 3.5.1. Mounting the GNSS Smart Antenna The smart antenna's enclosure is completely waterproof and is designed for outdoor installation. It is protected against interfering signals and thus is suitable for reliable operation in most environments. Select an outdoor location for the antenna, like the roof of your building that has a relatively unobstructed view of the sky. Dense wood and concrete or metal structures will shield the antenna from satellite signals. The antenna can receive satellite signals through glass, canvas and thin fibreglass; thus it may be mounted inside a skylight, if an outdoor location is not possible. The smart antenna is an active-head antenna. For optimal performance, locate the smart antenna as far as possible from transmitting antennas, including radar, satellite communication equipment and cellular transmitters. When locating the antenna near a radar installation, ensure that the antenna is positioned outside of the radar's cone of transmission. Follow the same guidelines when installing the antenna near satellite communication equipment. For best results, mount the antenna at least ten feet away from satellite communication equipment. Do not mount the antenna near high vibration areas such as fan or motor housings, or near sources of heat such as exhaust stacks. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 3-8 Revision 0.1 INSTALLATION  When mounting two or more smart antennas they must be spaced at least 3 feet (1 meter) apart to prevent interference. Consider the length of the cable run when selecting the location. A 50 foot cable is supplied; however, longer cables are available on special order from the factory. You may also wire a straight-through extender cable to extend the able distance up to 200 feet. The smart antenna is designed for a pole mount with a 1\" - 14 straight thread, which is a common marine antenna mount. For stationary installations a 3/4\" pipe thread can be used, but a 1\"-14 straight thread is recommended. Pole mounting is illustrated in Figure 3-2. Secure the mounting pole to a solid structure so that it is oriented vertically. Thread the smart antenna onto the pole or pile and hand tighten until snug.  CAUTION: Over-tightening the smart antenna on the pole or using a tool could damage the threaded socket in the base of the antenna. In addition, do not use thread-locking compounds, since they can dissolve or embrittle plastic Figure 3-2: Pole Mounting the Smart Antenna 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System INSTALLATION Revision 0.1 Page 3-9 3.5.2. Connecting the GNSS Smart Antenna to the 5700MSC-IP A standard 50 foot long interface cable (Evertz part WA-T09) is provided with the 5700MSC-IP and the smart antenna. One end of this cable is fitted with a weather-tight 12-pin Deutsch IMC21 connector. The other end is fitted with a 9-pin male sub-miniature D connector and should be connected to the GNSS connector on the rear panel of the 5700MSC-IP. The pinout of the cable is shown in Table 3-6. If you require a longer cable, a 100 foot (Evertz part WA-T76), 200 foot cable (Evertz part WA-T10), 400 foot cable (Evertz part WA-T11), 800 foot cable (Evertz part WA-08) or 1200 foot cable (Evertz part WA-T12) may be ordered from the factory. Custom length weatherproof cables can also be special ordered. Alternately, you can wire a 9-pin Extender cable as shown in Table 3-7. Connect the 12-pin connector on the interface cable to the smart antenna. The connector on the interface connector has a locking ring for securing the connection.  CAUTION: Over tightening the locking ring can damage the connector on the smart antenna. Fasten finger-tight until snug. Using tools will damage it. Route the interface cable to the location of the 5700MSC-IP unit using the most direct path. Avoid routing the cable near hot surfaces, sharp or abrasive surfaces, or corrosive fluids or gases. Avoid sharp kinks or bends in the cable. Additional protection such as heat shrink tubing may be required to protect the cable jacket at points where the cable enters the building, especially if the opening is rough or sharp. Once the cable is run, use cable-ties to secure the cable to the pole and to provide strain relief for the connections. When securing the cable, start at the antenna and work towards the 5700MSC-IP unit. Connect the 9-pin male D connector to the GPS connector on the rear panel of the 5700MSC-IP. Power is provided from the 5700MSC-IP along the interface cable to the smart antenna.  It is best to keep the antenna cable run as short as possible. If two 5700MSC-IP units are being used, each with their own GNSS antenna, the antenna cable lengths should be matched as closely as possible. 123456789101112 Trimble Antenna Deutsch IMC-series 12-pin (female) Cable Wire Evertz 5700MSC-IP 9-pin D-Sub (male) 123456789 DC Ground 9 Black 1 Chassis Ground Receive Port (Rx-) 2 Violet 2 Tx A - Transmit Port (Tx+) 5 Yellow 3 Rx B + Timing Pulse (1pps+) 11 Orange+White 4 1pps + in DC Power 1 Red 5 +12 V DC Timing Pulse (1pps-) 12 Black+White 6 1pps - in Receive Port (Rx+) 3 Orange 7 Tx B + Transmit Port (Tx-) 4 Brown 8 Rx A - ---- Drain Wire shell Table 3-6: Evertz-provided GPS Cable (part WA-T09) Internal Wiring 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 3-10 Revision 0.1 INSTALLATION 123456789 9-pin Female D-Sub Pin Cable Pair 9-pin Male D-Sub Pin Description 123456789 7 1 7 TX B + 2 2 TX A - 8 2 8 RX A - 3 3 RX B + 4 3 4 1 PPS + 6 6 1 PPS - 5 4 5 +12 V DC 1 1 Ground ----------- Drain ------------ Shield Table 3-7: Accutime Gold Extender Cable  When making your own extender cable be sure to use low capacitance twisted pair cable and adhere to the pairing shown in Table 3-7. 3.5.3. System Start-up At power up, the smart antenna will automatically begin to acquire and track the GNSS satellite signals. From a cold start, the smart antenna will normally take from 2 to 5 minutes to lock on to sufficient satellites to accurately determine the time. Refer to section 2.5.2 for more information. During this time the Lock Status and Inputs status screens on the front panel will show the various stages of initialization (see section 4.1.2). For complete information on configuring the 5700MSC-IP to operate with the GNSS Smart antenna see section 4.3.1 of this manual. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 4-1 4. HOW TO OPERATE THE MASTER CLOCK SYSTEM The model 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock and Video Master Clock System combines the latest LSI technology with sophisticated embedded microcontroller firmware to provide a powerful, flexible, and upgradeable system. This combo IP Network Grand Master Clock and Master Sync Generator is ideal for timing today‟s IP based video broadcast, production, and distribution facilities. It provides all of the future timing needs of an IP based plant while providing precision reference to any baseband SDI/Analog systems. 4.1. FRONT PANEL CONTROLS Figure 4-1: Model 5700MSC-IP Front Panel Layout The front panel controls consist of two color LCD displays, 10 pushbuttons and a control knob. The buttons are used to navigate the front panel menu system, view status information, and to change various settings on the unit. The control knob can also be used to navigate the menu system and make changes to settings. Pressing in the control knob is equivalent to pressing the SELECT button in most cases. Press the HELP button at any time to view information on any currently selected menu item. The two color LCD displays are used to display the menu system and the current position within the menu tree. There are also messages on the left LCD that indicate system status. Sections 4.3 to 4.5 give detailed information on the specific operations required to control the 5700MSC-IP. 4.1.1. Front Panel Buttons There are four buttons to the right of the control knob that are used to select the four main root menus. These buttons are labelled INPUT, OUTPUT, GENERAL, and STATUS. These buttons will illuminate to show which menu is currently active. The control knob and the four green buttons to the left, , , SELECT, and ESC, are used to navigate the menu system and change settings. The PANEL LOCK button can be used to lock the front panel to prevent accidental button presses after the unit has been configured (see section 4.1.3). The HELP button can be pressed at any time to display online help about the currently selected menu or menu item. INPUT - Enters the INPUT menu that contains various menus for configuring the frequency and time references of the 5700MSC-IP and how to lock to them. See section 4.3. OUTPUT - Enters the OUTPUT menu that is used to configure the Sync and test generator outputs of the 5700MSC-IP. See section 4.4. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 4-2 Revision 0.1 OPERATION GENERAL - Enters the GENERAL menu that contains controls for configuring the Syncro, GPOs, DST, SNMP, and NTP features of the 5700MSC-IP. See section 4.5. SELECT - In the menu system the SELECT button is used to enter a sub-menu or to select a menu parameter that is to be changed. ESC - When in a sub-menu the ESC button is used to exit the next higher menu level. It is also used to abort changing the setting of a menu item. ,  - The arrow buttons are used to navigate through the menu system. The currently selected menu item is indicated by the > character. The arrow buttons are used to select the next or previous menu item. When changing a menu item‟s value, the arrow buttons are used to select the next or previous items in a list, or for a numerical value are used to increment or decrement the current value. CONTROL - The control knob can be used as an alternative to the  and  buttons and allows quicker navigation and setting of menu items. Turning the control knob clockwise (to the right) has the same effect as pressing the  button. Turning the control knob counter-clockwise (to the left) has the same effect as pressing the  button. Depressing the control knob inwards has the same effect as pressing the SELECT button. When changing a numerical value (such as when phasing an output) depressing the knob while turning allows changing the numerical value in steps of 16. This makes it easier to change large numerical values.  When in the menu or a selection list, pressing the control knob has the same effect as pressing the SELECT button. When adjusting a numerical value, depressing the control knob while turning it will increment or decrement in larger steps of 16. 4.1.2. The Status Screens There are several status screens available on the 5700MSC-IP that can be accessed by pressing the STATUS button on the front panel. Each screen displays relevant information about the subsystem it represents. At the root level, the screens are listed just like menu items. Press the  and  buttons or turn the control knob to move the selection cursor to the desired status screen. Press SELECT to view the status screen. The ESC button will return to the status screen list.  The status screens are still accessible even when the front panel is locked. The status screen list can be used to quickly locate the source of a fault within the 5700MSC-IP. Each status screen name will be shown in normal text if the subsystem it represents is functioning normally. The status screen name will be shown with a yellow background if one of the items inside is in a warning condition. The status screen name will have a red background if one of the subsystems is faulted. By scrolling through the status screen list, any faults can be quickly identified. Refer to Figure 4-2. In this example, the Lock status screen is shown with a yellow background to warn that an item inside has a problem. The Fan/PS status screen is shown with a red background to indicate that one of the power supplies is not functioning. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 4-3 Figure 4-2 : Status Screen Highlighting to Indicate Warnings and Faults The status screens are described in detail below. Each status screen can display multiple messages depending on the configuration of the 5700MSC-IP.  Pressing the STATUS button then scrolling through the status screen names is a quick way to see if there are any problems with the 5700MSC-IP. Screens that are in fault or warning conditions will be highlighted RED or YELLOW. System / In time hh:mm:ss:ff The System/In time status screen shows the system clock time and date on the first two lines. The third line, prefixed with “L i\", shows the current LTC timecode being read from the LTC/IRIG input (if present). If the LTC input is lost, the time shown here will be replaced with “--:--:--:--”. If drop frame is detected, the last colon „:‟ will be replaced with a period „.‟. The fourth line, prefixed with “V i\", shows the current timecode being read from VITC on the reference input. If the VITC input is lost, the time shown here will be replaced with “--:--:--:--“. If drop frame is detected, the last colon „:‟ will be replaced with a period „.‟. The fifth line, prefixed with “I”, shows the current IRIG timecode being read from the LTC/IRIG input (if present). If the IRIG input is lost, the time shown here will be replaced with “--:--:--:--“. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 4-4 Revision 0.1 OPERATION Sync 1-6 hh:mm:ss:ff The Sync 1-6 status screen shows the VITC clocks for the sync outputs in “hours:minutes:seconds:frames” format. The delimiter between the hours and minutes indicates whether Daylight Saving Time is being applied to that output. It will be a period “.” when DST is enabled and a colon “:” otherwise. The delimiter between the seconds and frames indicates whether dropframe counting is being used on the VITC output. It will be a period “.” when dropframe counting is enabled, and a colon “:” otherwise. In the example to the left, the VITC on sync output 1 has been set to Eastern Standard Time (Time Zone to UTC –5:00) and has DST enabled (1 hour advanced). Sync outputs 1 to 3 are all in dropframe counting mode. The timecode clocks for sync outputs 5, 6, and 7 are dimmed because they are set to an output mode which doesn‟t support VITC. Although VITC is not being inserted onto these sync outputs, the timecode clocks continue running. LTC/Wc/Ten MHz hh:mm:ss:ff The LTC/Wc/Ten MHz status screen shows the LTC/IRIG output clocks and the VITC output clocks for the wordclock and 10MHz outputs. If the LTC/IRIG outputs have been configured to output LTC, the current output timecode will be shown on lines 1 or 2 prefixed with “L1” or “L2”. If they have been configured to output IRIG, the current output timecode will be shown on lines 4 or 5 prefixed with “I1” or “I2”. If the Wordclock or 10MHz outputs have been configured to output black burst with VITC enabled, these clocks will be displayed on lines 3 and 4 as bright white. In the example to the left, the Wordclock and 10MHz output have been left in their default modes (cannot insert VITC onto a wordclock or 10MHz CW signal). The VITC timecode clocks are dimmed to show that the timecode is not being inserted. On all timecode lines, the delimiter between the hours and minutes indicates whether Daylight Saving Time is being applied to the output. It will be a colon “:” if DST is disabled, and a period “.” If DST is enabled (see I2 in example to the left). For VITC/LTC timecodes, the delimiter between the seconds and frame counts indicates whether dropframe counting is enabled. It will be a period “.” If dropframe counting is being used, and a colon “:” otherwise (see L1 in example to the left). SDI 1-4 ATG 1-2 hh:mm:ss:ff The SDI 1-6 ATG 1-2 status screen shows the clocks for each of the test generator burn-in displays in “hours:minutes:seconds:frames” format. The delimiter between the hours and minutes indicates whether Daylight Saving Time is being applied to that output. It will be a period “.” when DST is enabled and a colon “:” otherwise. The delimiter between the seconds and frames indicates whether dropframe counting is being used on the time output. It will be a period “.” when dropframe counting is enabled, and a colon “:” otherwise. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 4-5 Lock status Unlocked  Locked [#1] 10MHz frequency ref, no time ref [#2] GPS frequency ref, GPS time ref [#3] No frequency ref, Modem time ref [#4] Video frequency ref, VITC time ref The Lock Status screen displays the current status of the selected frequency and time references for the 5700MSC-IP.

Panel Lock Function Pressing the PANEL LOCK button will lock the front panel. The PANEL LOCK button will illuminate indicating that the front panel keys are disabled. This is used to prevent accidental changes to the unit once it has been configured. While the front panel is locked, the STATUS screens will still be accessible. It will still be possible to press the STATUS button and view the various status screens but it will not be possible to enter any other menu or change menu items. To unlock the panel, press the PANEL LOCK button while holding the SELECT button. The front panel will return to normal operation and the PANEL LOCK button LED will turn off. Note that pressing HELP and PANEL LOCK at the same time will also turn off the panel lock. 4.1.4. Front Panel LCD Displays There are two full color LCD displays on the front panel. The left LCD indicates the current position in the menu structure as well as system health status. The right LCD is used to display the menu system and status screens. The left LCD display shows the current position in the menu tree. In the bottom-left corner the system status is shown. A critical fault will appear in red blinking text. The possible system status messages are summarized in Table 4-1 in order of severity: Message Description Hw fail Appears blinking red in the bottom-left corner. Indicates that an internal hardware problem has been detected. It is advisable not to remove power from the unit and to contact the factory immediately. See 2.2.3 for more information. Temp Hi Appears blinking red in the bottom-left corner. Indicates the internal temperature of the unit has exceeded operating limits. Requires immediate attention. May be due to excessive ambient temperature, fan failures, missing power supply or fan module, or blocked exhaust vents on the side of the unit. Ps fail Appears blinking red in the bottom-left corner. Indicates that one of the power supplies is not producing the correct voltage. Only applicable for dual power supply installations. If only a single power supply is in use, make sure the Number PS menu item is set correctly. Warning Appears in yellow text in the bottom-left corner. Indicates a non-critical fault in the unit such as frequency or time reference missing, or fan failure. Sys Ok Appears in green text in the bottom-left corner. Indicates no system fault. Table 4-1: System Status Messages 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 4-8 Revision 0.1 OPERATION In the bottom-right corner of the left LCD the frequency reference status is shown. When Ref Ok is displayed this means the currently selected frequency reference is present and the 5700MSC-IP has locked to it properly. This will be Ref unlk with a yellow background if the frequency reference is missing or the 5700MSC-IP is unable to lock to the supplied reference. Other messages are possible on the left LCD. These messages require a manual user jam, or mode change to clear. Such messages include REF JAM NEEDED, which will be displayed if the 5700MSC-IP is in Slow mode and is in the process of gradually relocking to a change in the frequency reference. If the time reference lock type has been set to USER, then TIME JAM NEEDED will be displayed when the system time and reference time mismatch. 4.2. FRONT PANEL MENU SYSTEM The 5700MSC-IP menu system consists of three root menus. The INPUT, OUTPUT, and GENERAL buttons allow you to quickly go to each of the three main menus, while the SELECT, ESC,  and  buttons and control knob are used to navigate the menu. To enter the Input menu, press the INPUT button, which will then illuminate to show that it is now the active menu. Likewise the Output or General menus can be entered by pressing the OUTPUT or GENERAL buttons. The menu selections will be displayed on the right LCD. The > character is used as a selection cursor to show which menu item is currently selected. Use the  and  buttons or turn the control knob to move the > character beside the desired sub-menu and press the SELECT button to enter it. The menu tree is shown on the left LCD and identifies which menus have been entered. Press the ESC button to return to the previous level in the menu structure. When a menu item is selected, there can be several different formats to modifying the value of the selected setting. The most common is the selection list. In a selection list, the currently active value is highlighted in white. The > character can be moved to select a new value, but the change won‟t take effect until the SELECT button is pressed, after which the new value will become highlighted to show it is now active. Press the ESC button at any time to exit from the selection list. Other formats are used for changing numeric items. When accessing some menu items, the message LIVE CONTROL will be displayed on the left LCD with a red background. This message is a warning that pressing SELECT on the menu item will perform an immediate task such as jamming a reference. Use caution with such menu items. When adjusting the value of some settings, the message LIVE CONTROL will be displayed on the left LCD with a yellow background. This message is a warning that any change made with the  and  buttons or control knob will immediately be applied to the output without requiring the SELECT button to be pressed. An example is when adjusting phase of the sync outputs or when adjusting the analog audio levels. Proceed with caution and press the ESC button to return to the previous menu without making a change. Sections 4.3 to 4.5 provide detailed descriptions of the INPUT, OUTPUT and GENERAL menus. The tables in these sections are arranged in an indented structure to display the path to reach each control. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 4-9 4.3. CONFIGURING THE INPUT REFERENCES The INPUT menu is used to set up various items related to the input references of the 5700MSC. The chart below shows the items available in the INPUT SETUP menu. Frequency Ref Contains items controlling the frequency reference and how to lock to it Time Contains items related to the time reference and how to lock to it Jam Input Contains live controls that can force the 5700MSC to lock immediately to the frequency or time reference Table 4-2: Root Level of the INPUT Menu 4.3.1. Selecting the Frequency Reference INPUT The Reference Src menu item in the Frequency Ref menu is used to select the frequency reference that the 5700MSC will use to lock its internal oscillator. All outputs are driven from a common oscillator and therefore are clock locked to each other (i.e. they do not drift with respect to each other). When set to the different possible reference sources and the appropriate reference is supplied, the phasing of the video and DARS outputs is affected as shown in the lock diagram in section 2.2. When set to GNSS the 5700MSC will lock its ovenized oscillator to the 1pps pulse from the GNSS smart antenna. Selecting this option forces the Genlock Range to Narrow. All outputs are phased with respect to a specific date in GNSS time. This forces the time reference to GNSS time. The GNSS-disciplined internal oscillator will maintain superb long-term accuracy. Refer to section 2.2.13 for more information. When set to 10 MHz the 5700MSC will look for a 10MHz or 5MHz frequency reference on the reference loop input. It will lock in either Narrow or Wide mode, depending on the Genlock Range setting. The 10MHz or 5MHz reference supplies no phase information and the phase of the outputs will change if the unit is powered down and rebooted. The phase between different 5700MSC units locked to 5MHz or 10MHz will not be the same. When set to Video the 5700MSC will lock to a valid black burst or tri-level video signal applied to the reference loop inputs. The Genlock Range menu item is used to select the tolerance of the master oscillator lock range. Note that the 5700MSC requires a colorburst on NTSC and PAL references, with a SCH error of less than 35º. Burst is not required for Slo-PAL bi-level references. Refer to section 2.2.5 for more information. When set to Internal the 5700MSC will free-run on its internal ovenized oscillator. This forces the Genlock Range to Narrow. The stability of this ovenized oscillator is 0.01ppm, which corresponds to a time drift of about 0.31 seconds per year. Refer to section 2.2.12.1 for more information. Frequency Ref Reference Src GNSS Ten MHz Video Internal 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 4-10 Revision 0.1 OPERATION 4.3.2. Configuring the Genlock Capture Range INPUT The Genlock Range menu item is used to select the type of oscillator to use when locking to video or 5/10MHz references. See section 2.2.3. Set this to Narrow to use the ovenized oscillator when the frequency stability of the reference is tightly controlled and within ±0.1 ppm. The ovenized oscillator provides excellent stability and enables use of the Slow lock mode. The Slow lock mode allows the 5700MSC to recover smoothly from a loss of reference or reference shift condition. The Narrow range is superior to the Wide range in every way except in lock time and lock range. It is the default setting and does not normally need to be changed. Select the Wide range only when a wide locking range of ±15ppm is required and when very fast lock times are needed. This may be required in some post-production facilities where the input reference is changing occasionally and a fast relock time is desired. Low freerun stability and slightly higher jitter are the drawbacks of the wide range. Frequency Ref Genlock Range Narrow Wide 4.3.3. Selecting the Frequency Reference Lock Type INPUT The Lock Type menu item is used to select how the 5700MSC will relock to its frequency reference when the reference is lost and then regained, or experiences a change. See section 2.2.4 for more information. In Abrupt mode, whenever the 5700MSC detects that its internal oscillator is no longer synchronized to the reference it will make a sudden change to bring it back into lock. This may cause disturbances to the outputs as the unit shifts its frequency and phase. In Slow mode, when the 5700MSC detects that its internal oscillator is not synchronized to the reference it will report REF JAM NEEDED on the LCD display and optionally send an SNMP trap. The unit will then slowly adjust its internal oscillator to bring it back into lock with the reference. This gradual correction will not cause any disturbances to the outputs as they re- phase. This adjustment may take a long time, depending on the size of the discrepancy between the internal oscillator and reference. If the unit is required to lock to its reference without delay the user can perform a manual jam by selecting the Jam Input menu item. The Slow lock type is only available if the Genlock Range is set to Narrow. Frequency Ref Lock Type Slow Abrupt  If a large shift in the reference occurs while Slow lock mode is enabled, the outputs of the 5700MSC may be out of phase for a long time while relocking. The 5700MSC will gradually slew its oscillator to bring it back into phase with the reference. This slewing action combined with the phase shift may seem to indicate that the unit is completely unlocked to the reference. This is not a fault and a manual jam can be performed to force the 5700MSC to lock immediately. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System OPERATION Revision 0.1 Page 4-11 4.3.4.

SERVICING INSTRUCTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING CAUTION: These servicing instructions are for use by qualified service personnel only. To reduce risk of electric shock, do not perform any servicing instructions in this section of the manual unless you are qualified to do so. CAUTION: If the unit is fitted with dual power supplies, make sure that power is removed from both supplies before performing any work on the unit. There is no power switch so the power cords must be unplugged. 5.4.1. Changing the Fuses CAUTION: For continued protection against the risk of fire, replace only with the same type and rating of fuse. ATTENTION: Pour éviter les risques d’incendie, remplacer le fusible avec un fusible de même calibre. Each power supply module contains a fuse. The fan module does not have a fuse. Remove the front panel to gain access to the mounting screw on the front of the power supply module. Unscrew the Phillips screw and remove the module by pulling on the handle. The fuse is located at the rear of the supply behind the rear connector and fan. Pull out the blown fuse being careful not to bend or damage the diode and place a fuse of the correct value in its place. Use a slow-blow (time delay) 5x20mm fuse rated for 250 Volts with a current rating of 1 Amp. Carefully reinsert the module, checking to make sure the diode doesn‟t impact the chassis. Secure the power supply module using the Philips mounting screw and replace the front panel. 5.4.2. Replacing the Battery The 5700MSC-IP is fitted with a 3V 20mm diameter Lithium battery type CR2032. This battery is used to power the clock while power is removed from the unit. If the unit is not keeping time properly when it is powered down, the battery should be replaced according to the procedure outlined in section 5.4.2.1. Before attempting to change the battery remove power from the 5700MSC- IP. 5700MSC-IP IP Network Grand Master Clock & Video Master Clock System Page 5-6 Revision 0.1 TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION CAUTION Danger of explosion if battery is incorrectly replaced.
