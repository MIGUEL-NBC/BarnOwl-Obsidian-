Communication with Center Control Panel (CCP) using the peripheral LAN, control of the RC-90 board and IF-848 board that are installed as options, generating the sync signal from the REF video signal, the Tally/GPI input, and serial tally output. The CA-47 board is installed in slot 1 of the MKS-8700 main unit. The CPU-DK module (main CPU board) that is connected to CN201 controls the Ethernet Controller. The control signal passes through the MB-949 board and the CN-2198 board on the rear, and establishes communication with the Center Control Panel (CCP) at CN202. The CPU-DK module establishes interface with PIO on the RC-90 board that is installed in slot 2 to slot 6, by receiving command from the Center Control Panel. In the same manner, the CPU-DK module establishes interface with the IF-848 board using the 32-bit dual port RAM on the IF-848 board that is installed in slot 2 to 6. In the same manner, the CPU-DK module interfaces with the SIO that controls RS-422A via the 8-bit dual port RAM. The serial tally signal supplied from SIO passes through the driver/receiver complying with the RS-422A standard, again passes through the MB-949 board and the CN-2198 board on the rear, and finally interfaces with external equipment at CN201. The Tally/GPI input signals that are input to CN301 to CN303 on the CN-2193 board on the rear slot 1, passes through the MB-949 board, and are input to PIO on the CA-47 board. The CPU-DK module reads out contents of the PIO and sends the Center Control Panel of the contents. The REF video signal that is input to CN601 or CN602 of the CN-2199 board on the rear is sent to the sync separator circuit where the sync signal is generated. The power supply voltages of +3.3 V and +5 V within the CA-47 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-949 board. DCU-8000 26 TALLY/GPI OUTPUT BOARD/ CONNECTOR BOARD— RC-90/CN-2195 (MKS-8701) DCU-8000 26 TALLY/GPI OUTPUT BOARD/ CONNECTOR BOARD— RC-90/CN-2195 (MKS-8701) RC-90 Board (MKS-8701) The RC-90 board contains the 54 channels of the Tally Output and the GPI Output circuits. Each channel is used either as Tally or GPI. The information whether each channel is used as Tally or GPI is memorized in the Center Control Panel side to which the MKS-8700 Device Control Unit (DCU) is connected. The RC-90 board can be installed in any desired slot of slot 2 to slot 6 of the MKS-8700 main unit. The Tally Output data and the GPI Output data are written in the PIO of the RC-90 board from the main CPU of the CA-47 board installed in slot 1. The Tally Output data and GPI Output data turn on and off the relays and feed the output connectors CN501 to CN503 via the MB-949 board and the CN-2195 board on the rear slot. The power supply voltages of 3.3 V and +5 V within the RC-90 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-949 board. The relays are directly driven by +12 V. DCU-8000 27 SERIAL INTERFACE BOARD/ CONNECTOR BOARD— IF-848/CN-2194 (MKS-8702) DCU-8000 27 SERIAL INTERFACE BOARD/ CONNECTOR BOARD— IF-848/CN-2194 (MKS-8702) IF-848 Board (MKS-8702) The IF-848 board contains the six channels of the RS-422A interface circuit that controls VTRs and other equipment. All of the six channels can be used as the Serial GPI Output as desired. The IF-848 board can be installed in any of the desired slot of slot 2 to slot 6 of the MKS-8700 main unit. The CPU-DK module (IF CPU board) that is installed in the CN610 interfaces with the main CPU of the CA-47 board installed in slot 1 via the 32-bit dual port RAM. The IF-848 board receives the control information from the main CPU of the CA-47 board and sends it to the SIO controlling the RS-422A via the 8-bit dual port RAM. The single SIO can control the two channels of the RS-422A. The control data establishes interface with the external equipment at CN401 to CN406 via the driver/receiver complying with the RS-422A standard and via CN2194 on the rear slot. The power supply voltages of +3.3 V and +5 V within the IF-848 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-949 board.
