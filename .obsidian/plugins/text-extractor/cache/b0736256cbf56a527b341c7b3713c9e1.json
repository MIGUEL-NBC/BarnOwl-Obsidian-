Errors are more severe than warnings, obviously. An example of an error would be a failed panel or processor card in the console or core. An example of a warning would be that one of the power supplies is either unplugged or failed. The notification on the Artemis is in the lower right of the Calrec application, as well as the FAIL WARNING red button in the center section. On the Brio the notification is at the top right of the touchscreen. If the message is an error, then the box will be red. If the message is a warning, then it will be amber. System Status Messages will be displayed for the console itself, as well as some messages from other consoles and the main routing core. There are 2 reasons for clearing messages. One is if the message is unimportant to a specific console. For instance, an I/O box is no longer needed and is taken off the network. A message will be generated, but no one really needs to see a warning about that. A current example would be the removal of the Summa console in old CR 74. The error message in that case is passed on, through the main routing core, to the other consoles on the network. Another reason to clear messages is if they get stuck, and don’t clear on their own. This happens when you have networked consoles. NBC has one of the largest Hydra2 networks in the world. Obviously real problems should be addressed as soon as possible, but having unimportant and/or stuck messages will cause real issues to be ignored and go unreported. We don’t want A-1s to ignore the message warnings, and that will happen if messages are not cleared. The difficulty with clearing stuck, and unimportant, messages is that the proper way of doing it involves a processor reboot, which must be scheduled. But there is a way to hide the messages on a console, effectively ignoring them when it is appropriate. The routing cores will need to use the “proper” method, but the concern of this document is safely clearing messages on Artemis and Brio consoles so that A-1s will notice new issues and then report the message to support. We want them to notice the red or amber warning and not say, “It’s always like that”. One important thing to note, if you were to reboot the console after using this method of hiding the messages, then you will have to hide them again. Applications Needed: To hide the messages on an Artemis you will need the Backup&Restore utility. You can find this on the Calrec Console PC in the C:\\Calrec\\Utils folder. You will not need to be logged in as CalrecAudioAdmin in order to access this application. If you can’t find the application, or just want your own copy, then go to this share: https://nbcuni- my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/206422794_tfayd_com/Documents/Herman%20Shared%20Files/Utilities/Backup%26 Restore?csf=1&web=1&e=7M0fbr . The shared folder contains the application itself, and a user guide. The Backup&Restore utility is very useful and will allow you to get logs, system backups, set the time on the router core, etc. To hide messages on a Brio, you will need the Clear System Status Message by ID batch file and plink. Go to this folder share for it: https://nbcuni- my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/206422794_tfayd_com/Documents/Herman%20Shared%20Files/Utilities/Clear%20Sy stem%20Status%20by%20ID?csf=1&web=1&e=VVjuol. The shared folder contains the ClearSystemStatus.bat file and plink.exe. You will need both, just copy the folder over.

On the Artemis, select the status box on the lower right of the screen and you will get a list of the messages. Here is an example from an Artemis: If you uncheck the Cleared and Info options box at the top, then you will narrow the list to current messages. Only have the Error and Warning options checked! That Is the preferred way of viewing this screen. The Brio display is similar, but the box is on the top of the touchscreen. Take note of the first column labeled ID, this will become important for clearing.

If you needed to download the app, then copy the downloaded folder to the desktop of the Console PC. Click on Connect on the middle Left and wait for the Connected message in the display. Then click on Run box next to Clear System Status ID on the lower right below Maintenance Tasks. Take note of the Message IDs from the System Status Messages display and enter the first one in the popup box. HOW-TO/SOP: Safely Clearing Calrec System Status Messages Department: Production Systems Infrastructure Author: John Herman Date: March 7, 2022 4 Production Systems Infrastructure HOW-TO- Safely Clearing Calrec System Status Mar 04 2022 v1.docx Click on OK to clear the message. Continue running the Clear System Status ID task, entering the remaining IDs, until there are no more active errors or warnings being showed. When you are finished, click on Disconnect on the middle left of the app and close the app. Clearing Messages on a Brio: In order to clear messages on a Brio you will need to connect a PC to one of the rear LAN connections on the rear of the Brio. To check the ip address of the LAN ports select System Settings right arrowed box on the upper right of the touchscreen, then select LAN Configuration in the left column. Make sure that your laptop’s NIC is in the same subnet as the LAN port that you are connected to on the Brio. If the port that you connect to does not have an ip address set, then do the following. Select the Edit box on the touchscreen, you will be asked to enter the Administrator username name and password. The username and password are both calrec. Enter an ip address that works with your laptop, for instance 192.168.1.11, with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. Once the port is set correctly, touch the Administrator mode indicator at the top of the screen. Touch the Active Show left arrowed box on the upper left of the touchscreen. Select the System Status box at the top of the touchscreen to get the list of active errors and warnings.

Enter the ip address of the Brio’s LAN port and the batch file will connect and ask you to enter the ID of a message to clear. If the batch file does not connect, then check your network settings and connections. Also, when I tried from my NBC laptop, I had to run the batch file as Administrator through Remedient. The first time you connect to the Brio you will have to approve the RSA key. This is normal. As you did on the Artemis, enter the IDs and clear them until all messages are cleared. Follow the instruction in the batch file until all messages are cleared. Once you are done clearing messages, then just close the popup and disconnect your laptop. That is it. As mentioned previously, if you reboot the Artemis or Brio, then the Syatem Status Messages will appear again.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
