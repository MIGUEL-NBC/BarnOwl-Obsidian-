Easily pass tallies between rooms, between floors, across campus buildings, to remote trucks, or around the world. Create complex and conditional tallies when on/ off is not enough. Easily scale your system for special events. The tally control system is a specific combination of hardware and software from Flex Control Network®, DNF’s field proven, modular platform of professional IP based machine controllers. Simple to Setup and Maintain Use your favorite web browser –Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc.– to configure and re-configure. Click on a configuration web page, select from a drop-down menu, fill in a text box. It’s that simple. Read source names from the facility router or manually enter them. For each source, enable global, local, or no aliases. IP Technology Flex Control Network is engineered from the ground up to deliver a network-grade infrastructure that reliably and accurately controls connected devices in the same room, across campus, and around the globe. Robust Ethernet Because Flex Control Network uses an embedded, non-Windows® operating system, it won’t compromise your network. Whether it resides on a sensitive corporate LAN or a dedicated network, or users access it through VPN, Flex provides reliable connectivity throughout your facility — and around the world. All configurations are stored in the Flex device controller. Copy configurations to and restore from a PC. Configuration and system actions are logged for later review in seven 1-day logs. Simple remote access to log files provides quick and easy diagnostic data to identify and resolve system and operational issues. Modular Architecture Flex Control Network’s unique archi- tecture and modular design lets you locate device controllers to optimize efficiency, and allows changes to be made to individual devices without affecting the whole operation. Flex’s distributed system architecture means that failure of an individual piece will not cripple the entire system.
