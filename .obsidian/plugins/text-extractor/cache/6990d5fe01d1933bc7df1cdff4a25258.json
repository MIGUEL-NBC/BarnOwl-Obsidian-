Ingested content entering the workﬂ ow needs to be processed and ready to output for a variety of platforms and formats, which traditionally necessitates separate video processors, gateways, encoders, decoders, transcoders, up/down/cross converters and IPTV encoders. Evertz’ 570iTXE offers facilities the ﬂ exibility to take anything in and send anything out by providing a single point of entry for all compressed and uncompressed signals, which eliminates the need for bulky workﬂ ows. This makes 570iTXE the ideal solution for hybrid broadcast facilities and broadcasters looking to transition to IP. The 570iTXE will act as the front edge of signal/content acquisition. The iTXE will create multiple transcoded versions (“tracks”) of each signal which can be routed, recorded, edited and played out from other downstream products. The 570iTXE provides incredible versatility, for example, if low latency is required the downstream device can use the J2K (or even ASPEN/2110) track, or the AVI–C track if editing is required. If basic in–house monitoring or rough cut editing via an external device is needed, low bitrate H.264 can be used. This offers incredible ﬂ exibility to live production workﬂ ows. In order to offer maximum workﬂ ow ﬂ exibility, the iTXE supports uncompressed, MPEG2, H264, J2K, HEVC, IP, SDI and ASI input formats. It also supports uncompressed, H.264 4:2:2 10–bit, 4:2:0 8–bit, MPEG–2 XDCAM and J2K IP and SDI outputs simultaneously. In addition, the uncompressed IP inputs and outputs support ASPEN over 10GbE with a futureproof upgrade path to support SMPTE 2110. Video/Audio Proc, Up/Down/Cross conversion, Frame Sync and Audio shufﬂ ing are all currently available on the iTXE and are used for normalizing incoming streams which typically would have been accomplished using additional downstream devices.
