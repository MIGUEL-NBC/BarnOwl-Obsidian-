For details on the formatting method, refer to the Operating Instructions of the device to be used. When the RM-B150 or RM-B750 Remote Control Unit is connected, some camcorder functions can be controlled from the RM-B150/ B750. You can use the RM-B750’s display or a video monitor connected to the MONITOR connector of the RM-B150/B750 to control the camcorder by menu operations and monitor the camcorder picture. To connect Using the remote cable (10 m (33 ft)) supplied with the RM-B150/B750, connect between the REMOTE connector (8-pin) of the camcorder and the camera connector of the RM-B150/B750. When you turn on the camcorder after the connection, the camcorder enters Remote Control mode. You can control menu and recording operations from the RM-B150/B750. For the functions that can be controlled from the RM-B150/B750, see “Functions That Can Be Controlled from the RM-B150/B750” on page 11. Notes • Remote Control operations cannot be made if USB connection to the camcorder is enabled. • Do not connect or disconnect the RM-B150/B750 when the camcorder is on. The following controls of the camcorder becomes inoperative when the RM-B150/B750 is connected. • GAIN selector •WHITE BAL switch • AUTO W/B BAL switch • SHUTTER selector • OUTPUT/DCC switch • Buttons and switches to which the Turbo Gain function has been assigned, including the ASSIGN. 1/3 switches, the ASSIGNABLE 4 • “Memory Stick” and are trademarks of Sony Corporation. • “Memory Stick PRO-HG Duo” and are trademarks of Sony Corporation. Operating from the RM-B150/B750 Adjusting the Camcorder from the RM-B150/B750 Operating from the RM-B150/B7508 switch, the COLOR TEMP. button, and the ASSIGNABLE 5 switch. • REC START button: the VTR button on the lens, and buttons and switches to which the function has been assigned using OPERATION >Assignable SW in the setup menu, including the ASSIGN. 1/3 switches, the ASSIGNABLE 4 switch, the COLOR TEMP. button, and the ASSIGNABLE 5 switch (when MAINTENANCE >Camera Config >RM Rec Start in the setup menu is set to [RM]). To connect the monitor to the RM-B150/ B750 The MONITOR connector (BNC type) of the RM-B150/B750 outputs a composite signal. To connect a monitor to the MONITOR connector on the RM-B150/B750, use the black cable supplied with the RM-B150/B750. To release Remote Control mode Turn off the camcorder and disconnect the RM- B150/B750. The settings on the controls on the camcorder become valid. Camera image quality adjustment items when the RM-B150/B750 is connected When the RM-B150/B750 is connected, the parameters for camera image quality adjustment items (paint data) are reset to the parameters that were specified the last time that RM-B150/B750 was connected. Function of the recording start/stop buttons when the RM-B150/B750 is connected When the RM-B150/B750 is connected, you can make a setting to determine which of the recording start/stop buttons you will use. This setting is made using MAINTENANCE >Camera Config >RM Rec Start in the setup menu. Relationship between the setting of the RM Rec Start item and the function of recording start/stop buttons Structure of the paint adjustment data The non-volatile memory of the camcorder used for storing paint adjustment data consists of two regions as shown below: one is the “main data block” that is used when a remote control unit is not connected, and the other is the “remote control data block” that is used when a remote control unit is connected. Paint adjustment data is automatically selected and output to the camera section depending on whether or not a remote control unit such as the RM-B150 is connected. Recording start/ stop button Settings of RM Rec Start RM CAM PARA Camcorder’s REC START button Disabled Enabled Enabled Lens’ VTR button Disabled Enabled Enabled Buttons and switches to which the recording start/ stop function has been assigned (ASSIGN. 1/3 switches, ASSIGNABLE 4 switch, COLOR TEMP. button, and ASSIGNABLE 5 switch) Disabled Enabled Enabled Remote control unit’s VTR button Enabled Disabled Enabled Operating from the RM-B150/B750 9 When a remote control unit is connected to the camcorder, the “remote control data block” is selected as the current paint data block, and the paint adjustment parameters that were in effect the last time the remote control unit was used are recalled. The settings of the absolute value rotational controls 1) and absolute value switches 2) are overwritten by those on the remote control unit after the remote control unit is connected. When the remote control unit is disconnected from the camcorder, the “main data block” becomes effective. Thus the camcorder will return to the settings that were in effect before the remote control unit was connected. 1) Absolute value rotational controls: The data corresponding to the angular position of controls is output. Rotational controls for which the data corresponding to the amount of their rotation is output are called relative value controls. 2) Absolute value switches: Like toggle switches or slide switches (except most momentary switches), the switches (or knobs) whose positions must coincide with their functions are called absolute value switches. When MAINTENANCE >Camera Config >RM Common Memory is set to [On] in the setup menu, you can use settings of the paint adjustment data stored in the main data block even if you connect the remote control unit. In this case, the settings stored in the main data block will be renewed when you change the settings on the remote control unit. Thus, the settings of the paint data made with the remote control unit can be retained even if the remote control unit is removed. However, if the switch position on the remote control unit differs from the one on the camcorder, the switch position on the camcorder takes precedence over that on the remote control unit. Also, it is possible to keep the settings that are in effect before you connect the remote control unit. In this case, you should set the control knob to the relative value mode on the remote control unit. For details, refer to the operation manual supplied with the remote control unit. 1 Set the DISPLAY switch to MENU. The camcorder menus can be displayed on a video monitor connected to the MONITOR connector of the RM-B150. 2 Select and set the menu items, using the MENU SELECT knob and the CANCEL/ENTER switch. 3 When the settings are completed, set the DISPLAY switch to ON or OFF to exit the menu. For details on operations of the RM-B150, refer to the operation manual of the RM-B150. 1 Press and light the MONITOR button then press the VF MENU button. The camcorder menus can be displayed on the RM-B750’s display or a video monitor connected to the MONITOR connector of the RM-B750. 2 Select and set the menu items, using the MENU SELECT knob, ENTER button, and CANCEL button. 3 When the settings are completed, press the VF MENU button to exit the menu.
