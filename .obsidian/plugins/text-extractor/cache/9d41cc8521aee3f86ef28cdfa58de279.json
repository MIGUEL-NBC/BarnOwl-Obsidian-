The MSE a Trio connects to is dependant on the desktop shortcut used to open it. Each points to either the primary or backup MSE. Once opened, you can see which MSE the trio is connected to by IP address on the application title bar. On the bottom portion of the Trio application is the loaded Profile, which dictates what engines the Trio has access to, and several status indicators: Gateway, Viz One, and MSE Database. These should be green. The engines available are laid out across the bottom. You can right click an engine to see the IP address. If the engine is up and ready, it will be green. Red or grey, check the status of that engine. Operators load shows and Playlists here. Most shows have a Sidekick panel loaded. If this is accidentally closed, you can re-open it by going into File>Show Properties, and selecting it from the Active VTW Template dropdown. The monitor in iNews needs to be enabled for the correct rundown. The monitor screen is accessed in iNews via Tools>Monitor and can be loaded here. You can also check the status of the monitor by right clicking on \"MON=\" in the bottom right of iNews. If the monitor is not loaded, contact the News Helpdesk (x4161). These screenshots are from within iNews. Once loaded, in the Trio application, the rundown should be set to Active. If an element doesn't appear, setting to inactive and active again can force a refresh of the playlist. The bottom right is the preview pane. This acts the same as an engine but runs in parallel with Trio. Restarting the Trio application also restarts the preview engine.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
