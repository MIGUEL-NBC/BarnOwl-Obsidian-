PLUG INTO POWER Discover more about the new KP-Series keypanels with OMNEO on board. www.rtsintercoms.com/kp-series Bosch Security Systems 2017, modiﬁ cations reserved MEET THE NEW KP-SERIES INTERCOM KEYPANELS WITH OMNEO IP TECHNOLOGY ON BOARD. ONE CABLE. UNLIMITED POSSIBILITIES. GET MORE SIMPLICITY, FLEXIBILITY AND INNOVATION, SO YOU CAN GET MORE OUT OF YOUR COMMUNICATION. High-Quality Design Get high quality, inside and out. The new KP-Series keypanels fea- ture a uniﬁ ed design, including color, contrast, resolution and view ing angle for complete commu- nication harmony. Plus, multiple controls through ergonomically- designed levers. Ultimate Flexibility The new KP-Series is future-proof and so is your communication. The unparalleled ﬂ exibility features automatic hardware recognition plus the open source technology of OMNEO, so you get full backward compatibility and easy scalability. KP-Series keypanels deliver superior digital audio using the Bosch-developed OMNEO which includes Audinate‘s Dante audio over IP technology, via either copper or ﬁ ber. The KP-Series provides high-quality audio, free of noise, delay and other artifacts present in older technology. The family includes a rich set of connectors as standard, including GPIO and RC. As with other RTS products, emphasis has been placed on backward compatibility with previous generations of matrices including analog technology. KP-Series keypanels utilize the latest generation of wide angle TFT displays, providing superior clarity, resolution and longer display life, along with high-quality readability under a variety of lighting conditions. The RTS OMNEO suit now fully supports Open Control Architecture (OCA) also known as AES70. RTS oﬀ ers diﬀ erent ﬁ rmware versions making it possible to load either OMNEO or RVON (RTS Voice over Network) protocol. The power consumption of the KP-Series keypanels is reduced to almost ﬁ fty percent compared to previous key- panels, making them the most environmentally friendly keypanels of RTS. OMNEO is based on two key tech- nologies – the media transmission component Dante from Audinate Pty, Australia and the system-con- trol component OCA (Open Control Architecture) – and is enhanced with additional Bosch speciﬁ c features. OMNEO provides highest inter- operability, ﬂ exibility, reliability and future-proof technology by utilizing open public standards. OMNEO oﬀ ers ultra-low-latency, studio-quality audio transmission and full system control on standard IP networks of all sizes, from a single building to transcontinental. OMNEO-equipped RTS products are backwards-compatible with existing RTS hardware, giving users the ability to grow into IP intercom incrementally. In contrast to tradi- tional IP-based audio protocols, OMNEO is unique in providing ultra-low network audio latency, fully synchronized studio-quality multi- channel audio as well as full, stand- ards-based device conﬁ guration and control data over existing IP networks and standard Ethernet hardware, making it extremely cost eﬀ ective and easy to install. By utilizing a standard IP Ethernet infrastructure, OMNEO-equipped products can be assembled into net - works of 2 to 10,000 cooperating devices – all sharing a common control system. OMNEO is TCP/IP layer 3 compliant. This allows logical addressing and data routing even in large networks. FULL IP CONNECTIVITY PROVIDING ROUTABILITY AND COMPATIBILITY.

BEST-IN-CLASS SOLUTIONS. EKP-4016 EKP-4016PB 16-Position HD Color Display Expansion Keypanel, 1 RU Connect up to 6 (KP-5032) or up to 7 (KP-4016) expansion panels for a maximum of 128 keys. KP-5032 KP-4016 KP-4016PB 16-Position HD Color Display Keypanel, 1 RU DKP-4016 16-Position HD Color Display Desktop/Wall-Mount Keypanel Four new KP-Series keypanel models complement the KP-Series keypanels family in the entry level segment. Depending on the intercom environment, these products can be connected to both digital (KP-3016 only) and analog RTS matrices and utilized as entry-level keypanels while still oﬀ ering the same intuitive, easy handling features. They can also be quickly installed in applications with predeﬁ ned requirements where the comprehensive connectivity options of the existing KP-series models are not needed, but with the same consistent industrial design, hardware and software platform and high-quality audio performance. KEY FEATURES • Each keypanel features full-color HD displays oﬀ ering well-balanced color, contrast and resolution. The keypanels are capable of displaying English, Kanji, Cyrillic, and simpliﬁ ed Chinese characters. • Intuitive, easy to learn operation with ergonomically designed listen/talk levers. All RTS keypanels have a con- sistent user interface and operation, which is intuitive and easy to learn. • Superior sound quality with design assistance provided by the Electro- Voice speaker engineering R&D group. • Backward compatible with existing RTS analog matrices and forward compatible with future-proof OMNEO IP architecture. • OMNEO technology onboard. The KP-3016 incorporates OMNEO media networking without the need for additional cards or add-ons.

RTS oﬀ ers two software packages for its KP-Series keypanels, designed for high-tech users including large broad- casters and organizations with more demanding requirements for audio-visual performance and remote control. The audio and control software packages represent a completely new way to enhance the functionality and investment value of existing RTS hardware. Each software package can be installed on the KP-5032 and KP-4016 keypanel models, including the DKP-4016 desktop keypanel. A one-time-only fee means there are no recurring payments. Once installed, the two packages create customized audio/control functionality that meets the most challenging requirements. KP-SERIES SOFTWARE PACKAGES. *The Audio and Control Software Packages are optional and can be installed on all KP-5032, KP-4016 and DKP-4016 keypanel models. RVON Codec RVON Codec: The ﬁ eld-proven RVON (RTS Voice over Network) codec for VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) enables communication between users across long distances, with superior sound quality compared to competitor software solutions. KP-Series users may now connect to matrices equipped with a suitable RVON interface, such as the RVON-16 for ADAM/ADAM-M or RVON-C for Cronus matrices. RVON uses the G.711 narrowband audio protocol, providing toll- quality audio at 64 kbit/s. KP-5032PB 32-Position HD Color Display Keypanel, 2 RU","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
