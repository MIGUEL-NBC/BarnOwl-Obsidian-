The 570EMR–AG–HUB can also be used for IP audio conversion including AES67 to 302M, and with the Audio Selector feature key enabled this module can be a hub to aggregate and select any audio on a mono basis, for example 4 mono channels from any input grouped together on a AES67 stream. The 570EMR–AG–HUB module provides a gateway to link into IP infrastructures as well as allow a more efﬁ cient way to tie–line routers together. IP–based audio packetized and transported over ﬁ ber will provide greater density and longer distances than traditional copper based solutions would yield. TDM audio sources and destinations include all EMR audio modules plus EQX embedders, deembedders and Frame sync options. The 570EMR–AG–HUB is hot–swappable and monitored via VistaLINK in any of the Evertz 570 modular frames. Applications for the 570EMR–AG–HUB include: • Bulk audio connection between audio systems such as connecting multiple mobile broadcast vehicles using EMR audio router modules • Audio bridging between devices supporting 302M or AES67 to EMR/EQX routing systems • Mono audio selection of any audio to any audio • AES67 to AES67 proﬁ le grooming • IP audio routing for radio using Evertz IP switches • Optimized for operation in a 10GbE and 25GbE IP SDVN environment Features & Beneﬁ ts • Audio gateway of external TDM signals into IP (Studer, Calrec, EMR audio) • IP conversion between ST302 and AES67 • AES67 to AES67 for proﬁ le grooming * • ST302M: maximum 512 multicasts per port * • AES67: maximum 512 multicasts per port * • 8TDM in, 8 TDM out (512 channels per TDM) • 10x10 MADI (64 channels per) as a purchasable option • Audio Selector is a purchasable option for selecting audio on mono basis • Purchasable option for pop suppression • VistaLINK® capable for remote monitoring, control and conﬁ guration capabilities via SNMP; using VistaLINK® PRO 2x 10GbE 2x 10GbE S F P S F P Audio Selector Licence enabled option ST 302M Encap/Decap AES67 Encap/Decap Module Control Status PTP PCR Reference Video Ref 570 Frame 10/100 Ethernet Ethernet (Through 570FC) VistaLINK ® Interface 8x TDM / MADI * IN 2x MADI * IN 8x TDM / MADI * OUT 2x MADI * OUT 570EMR–AG–HUB EMR Audio Gateway HUB","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
