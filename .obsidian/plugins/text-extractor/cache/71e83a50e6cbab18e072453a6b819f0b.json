It performs signal processing, provides an interface for external equipment, and supplies power to the camera. The CCU features a down converter which converts HD signals2) from a camera to SD signals3), and a simplified return video up converter which converts SD signals to HD signals. It is compatible with both HD camera system and SD camera system formats, making it flexible to use. 1) An HXC-100 and HSCU-300 can be connected if both units are of version 1.10 or later. 2) HD (High Definition) signal: Name for 1125/750-line HDTV signals 3) SD (Standard Definition) signal: Name for NTSC/PAL, 525/625 component, and 525/625 composite signals The CCU can be combined with an RCP-1000-series Remote Control Panel (optional) to form a camera control system. The CCU can also be combined with an MSU-1000/1500 Master Setup Unit (optional) over a LAN (Local Area Network) to form a multi-camera application system controlling multiple cameras. Features Multi-system input/output interface The HSCU-300 is equipped with the following input and output signal connectors as standard equipment. Video outputs • SDI (main), 2-system (HD/SD selectable, embedded digital audio) • SDI (monitor), 2-system (HD/SD selectable, embedded digital audio, superimposed character and marker display) • Analog composite (VBS 2-system, PIX 1-system, WF 1-system) • Analog component, 1-system (HD Y/Pb/Pr, HD R/G/B, SD Y/R-Y/B-Y, SD R/G/B 4-format selectable) • Sync, 1-system (HD/SD selectable) Video inputs • Reference input (HD/SD selectable) • SDI return input, 2-system (HD/SD selectable) • VBS return input, 2-system • VBS teleprompter input, 2-system When an HXC-100 is connected, 1-system of a VBS teleprompter input is available.

Either an HD tri-level sync signal or an SD sync (black burst) signal can be used as the sync signal. Digital triax transmission The CCU and camera are connected using the industry- standard double-shielded triaxial camera cable (commonly referred to as triax). The camera and CCU are equipped with the latest Sony-developed digital transmission technology which can transmit high-resolution pictures between the camera and CCU, regardless of the cable length. Built-in down converter HD signals from the camera can be converted to high- resolution SD component SDI output signals using the wideband down converter. The output signal aspect ratio can be set to 4:3 edge crop, 16:9 squeeze, or letterbox. The down converted SD signal has independent image enhancement, gamma, and matrix functions that can be controlled externally. Built-in simplified up converter SD signal return video is displayed in the HD viewfinder using a simple up converter. The return video aspect ratio can be set to 4:3 edge crop, 16:9 squeeze, or letterbox. Electric shock prevention A safety function cuts the high-voltage supply from the CCU if the connection to the camera becomes unsafe. When power is applied, low-voltage power is first supplied to the camera. After the connected camera is correctly identified using tone signal detection, the regular DC180 V high-voltage power is supplied to the camera. Power is not supplied to cameras not connected via the triax cable. Alarm indicators are also fitted to indicate cable open-circuit and short-circuit conditions. Wide range of audio functions The CCU is fitted with two-channel microphone output, video signals with embedded audio, and PGM (program) audio input/output connectors. It also features an intercom system with two independent channels, and supports four-wire and RTS/Clear-Com intercom systems. For information on support for RTS/Clear-Com systems, contact a Sony service or sales representative. Microphone volume control The camera’s microphone volume can be controlled via the MIC REMOTE connector.

Note that in summer the temperature in a car with the windows closed can reach 50 °C (122 °F). • Very damp or dusty places. • Where rain is likely to reach the unit. • Places subject to severe vibration. • Near strong magnetic fields. • Near transmitting stations generating strong radio waves. Avoid violent impacts Dropping the unit, or otherwise imparting a violent shock to it, is likely to cause it to malfunction. Do not cover with cloth While the unit is in operation, do not cover it with a cloth or other material. This can cause the temperature to rise, leading to a malfunction. After use Set the POWER switch on the CCU to the OFF position. Care If the body or panels of the unit become dirty, wipe them with a dry cloth. For severe dirt, use a soft cloth steeped in a small amount of neutral detergent, then wipe dry. Do not use volatile solvents such as alcohol or thinners, as these may damage the finish. Digital Triax Transmission Digital transmission between camera and CCU with powerful error correction function built-in. However, some errors, for example errors due to external noise in long-distance transmission, may be corrected by partial image interpolation of images in frame store. In digital triax transmission, the following video delay in transmission may occur. • The video delay in transmission between the camera and the CCU is approximately 9 to 12 ms. • A delay of about 1 frame occurs on the viewfinder display if a camera image is sent back from the CCU to the camera as a return signal. • A delay of about 5 frames occurs on the teleprompter video in standard mode (standard mode or low-latency mode using simplified images can be selected on the CCU). • An appropriate delay is applied to the MIC 1 and 2 audio signals from the CCU to match the video delay. • A certain time is required for the video signal transmitted between the camera and the CCU to stabilize after power is applied. This is not a malfunction. Triax transmission distances (when an HSC-300 is connected) The maximum and minimum transmission distances allowed for triax cable connections are shown in the table below. The distances may vary according to the conditions, such as the total power requirements (including the power supply to the camera from the CCU) and cable degradation. Allowable transmission range when using triax cables with the following characteristics: Attenuation: 3.8 to 68.4 dB at 100 MHz (including the connector loss) 1) If the transmission distance exceeds approximately 7/9 of the maximum transmission distance, the teleprompter transmitted image quality starts to deteriorate. 2) The maximum distance is 650 m (2133 ft) when the total power for the lens, viewfinder and utility outputs is between 100 and 120 W. Triax transmission distances (when an HXC- 100 is connected) The maximum and minimum transmission distances allowed for triax cable connection are shown in the table below. The distances may vary according to the conditions, such as cable degradation. Allowable transmission range when using triax cables with the following characteristics: Attenuation: 3.8 to 45.6 dB at 100 MHz (including the connector loss) Error Messages When an error is detected in the CCU or the camera, the ALARM indicator turns on and an error message is displayed on the CCU.
