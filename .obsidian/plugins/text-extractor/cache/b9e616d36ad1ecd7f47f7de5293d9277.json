The goal of the project is to cut down on power consumption and rack space, while additionally providing a way to access the application remotely via a Virtual Machine. There are two use cases: one for Routers where the application being virtualized is Grass Valley SEUtilities, and Comms, with the application being Shure Wireless Workbench or Pliant CrewWare. There are many installs around the building, mainly in 7S, 7A, 6B, 8G and the BOC. In time, more will be added to other studios and equipment rooms, the first of which being studio 6A sometime in early 2019. The clients are labeled with their name as well as the IP address of the VM. How it works: The Client needs HDMI (and an adapter if necessary), USB, Ethernet and power cords to be connected. The Thin Client is running an OS which initially boots when the device is powered up. From there, it immediately connects to a Windows Virtual Machine hosted on an outside service called Nutanix. This Virtual Machine is an image that has select applications specific to it’s use case. Each Thin Client has it’s own individual Virtual Machine that it connects to. There will be at least two IP addresses that are listed on the desktop, one for the VM and one for the Client itself. Lists of all IP addresses for both use cases are listed on pages 4 and 5. Initial Setup: Unless you are connecting using a straight HDMI cable, do not perform the following steps at the point of installation. The reason for this is that there is no guarantee the Thin Client’s Resolution Auto- Detect feature will work, resulting in a black screen. Research the monitor to be used and find it’s maximum resolution and refresh rate, to be input on step 4. Once booted with an NComputing splash screen, the Client will prompt the user with a setup wizard. Be sure to perform the next steps carefully: 1. Click “Skip Wizard” and OK. Go to the “General” menu. The default password is admin . In this menu, find the “Administrator Password space and input Caution1! . This is the password that we’ll be using for this part of the setup process, and is also the password for the user within the VM. Click Save. 2. Under the “Network” menu, navigate to “Interfaces” and click on Ethernet1. This will bring up a menu where you should configure the IP address to be “Static (Manual)” rather than any of the default “Dynamic (DHCP). Set the IP address to the assigned one from the Excel sheet listed on page 5 of this document. Now go back to “Network”, “Predefined hosts”, Add, and Edit. Input the following information: For Thin Clients being used for the Router use case (refer to the spreadsheet if you are unsure), input: 172.18.71.253. For Comms, use 100.113.37.36. Under hostname, type tcmgr. Thin Client Documentation for Maintenance 3. Under Services, click “NoTouch Center” and find the field for “Central Management URL”. Input: http://tcmgr:80/easyadmin . Find “Management URL Treatment” and select “HTTP only”. For “Search Management with Zeroconf”, set this option to “off”. 4. Under Display, click Monitor, then Edit. In there, set the Screen Resolution and Refresh rate settings to the monitor’s maximum. 5. Restart the ThinClient for changes to take affect by clicking “Start” and “Reboot”. After all of this is completed, it is crucial to inform Luke Casino and Chris Zembower (who are installing these devices) of the Client’s status. The NTouch Admin Console, which manages all of the Clients from a central control point, will need to be used to manually discover the device on the network. The Client itself will then be assigned a new image with essential internet connection, power, and display settings. Remote Connection: Routers For all of the Router Installations, you may use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to the virtual machine. Comms To connect remotely, make sure to use a VNC client in order to connect to the desired machine. DO NOT use Remote Desktop Connection! This will log out the user on the local machine, and will require you to log back in at the computer itself. Simply open any VNC Client and connect to the VM IP of the machine you’d like to access. You will be prompted for a password, which for all machines is “Awesome!” Once connected to the machine, you should be able to control it remotely for making changes or testing. Level 2 Support In case of a connection failure, issue with the VM, complete loss of the Thin Client, support should be directed to Chris Zembower, who can be reached at (212)664-2053 or Chris.Zembower@nbcuni.com If there are any further questions, please contact me at Lucas.Casino@nbcuni.com Thin Client Documentation for Maintenance #DeviceVM IPVM NameUsernamePasswordStudioThin Client IPIDUseResolutionStatus16BSDO RF RACKS100.113.37.113SHURE-6BSDO-6BRFRKAudioAwesome!6B100.113.67.1246BRFRKUnder Audience/RF Racks1280x1024 @60HzRunning26BSDO FOH MICs100.113.37.105SHURE-6BSDO-6BFOHAudioAwesome!6B100.113.67.1256BFOHFront of House Mics - above audience1440x900 @60HzRunning37A Audio Room MICs100.113.37.164SHURE-7AAUDAudioAwesome!7A100.113.67.2217AAUD7A Audio1280x1024 @60HzRunning48GSDO CrewWare100.113.37.184CCOM-8GSDOAudioAwesome!8G100.113.67.1578GSDOUnder audience - RF racks1920x1080RunningThin Client Documentation for Maintenance DeviceSysnet IPSubnet 255.255.0.0UserPwdLocationClient IPVM IPIdentifierStatusResolutionUpdated to FW 3818?1MG2 SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.21Needs to talk to 172.18.0.51/52routerCaution1!ERC2 R11A172.18.22.532EMGMounted22E SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.22Needs to talk to 172.18.0.25/56routerCaution1!ER-G-15172.18.32.22100.113.37.1072EERRunning1280x1024Yes3GFX SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.23Needs to talk to 172.18.0.31/32routerCaution1!ER-F-301172.18.32.23100.113.37.1322GFXRunning1280x1024Yes4N50 SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.24Needs to talk to 172.18.0.41/42routerCaution1!ER-C-60172.18.32.24100.113.37.1112N50Running1280x1024 Yes5ND1 SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.25Needs to talk to 172.18.0.45/46routerCaution1!ER-C-136172.18.32.25100.113.37.1822ND1Hold- KVM ISSUE?No - v 35126TSR SEUtil Client VM172.18.32.26Needs to talk to 172.18.0.21/22routerCaution1!ER-A-7A172.18.32.21100.113.37.1302TSRRunning1280x1024 Yes7FTX SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.27Needs to talk to 172.18.0.71/72routerCaution1!ER-B-35172.18.32.27100.113.37.1402FTXRunning1280x1024 No - v 35128HD3 SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.28Needs to talk to 172.18.0.35/36routerCaution1!ER-C-193172.18.32.26100.113.37.1312HD3Running1280x1024No - v 351293N SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.31Needs to talk to 172.18.3.57/58routerCaution1!ER-C-60172.18.3.603NERMounted10ROBO SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.32Needs to talk to 192.168.21.23/24routerCaution1!ER-3N-8172.18.3.74ROBOMounted11Decision Desk Client VM172.18.71.41Currently no connection to Sys NetrouterCaution1!DDesk ERTBDDDERHold12C71LR SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.71Needs to talk to 172.18.71.51/52routerCaution1!ER-7S-60172.18.71.5471LRMounted13C71MG SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.72Needs to talk to 172.18.72.51/52routerCaution1!ER-7S-60172.18.72.5471MGMounted14C74 SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.73Needs to talk to 172.18.73.51/52routerCaution1!ER-7S-60172.18.73.54100.113.37.196CR74Running1280x1024Yes15C72LR SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.74Needs to talk to 172.18.74.51/52routerCaution1!ER-7S-75172.18.74.5472LRMounted16C72MG SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.75Needs to talk to 172.18.75.51/52routerCaution1!ER-7S-75172.18.75.5472MGMounted178H SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.81Needs to talk to 172.18.8.51/52routerCaution1!ER-8-xx172.18.8.548HERMounted186E SEUtil Client VM172.18.71.61Needs to talk to 172.18.6.51/52routerCaution1!ER-6-xx172.18.6.546EERHold19EOD Main172.18.71.20AllrouterCaution1!EOD2-Rackxx172.18.22.55EOD1Mounted Thin Client Documentation for Maintenance Thin Client Documentation for Maintenance","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
