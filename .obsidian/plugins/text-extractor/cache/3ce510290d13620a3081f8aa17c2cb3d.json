The operator should be able to do everything they need to here, but these are steps for testing and troubleshooting. To initialize the show, go to the setup tab in the trio_vtw panel, click Load, wait for the status bar to finish, then Finalize. This will reset the show, branding, and ticker back to defaults. In the SHOWS LIST, select the show from the drop down, and click TRANS RUN. The BRAND tab selects various options. Channel A should be the default Live Path, Channel B the Record Path. The Footer tab shows ticker options. Usually set to TD IN so it can be brought it and out from the switcher.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
