The CPU module (CPU-DR or CPU-DT) board is mounted on the CA-57 board. The CPU module board is the center of the operations and establishes the communication with the equipment connected to the CTRL LAN, PERIPH LAN, SBUS and EDITOR ports in synchronism with the externally input REF VIDEO signal. It also establishes the communication with the MPU-302B board via internal LAN, and control of the device on the control panel. The built-in CPU of the FPGA (IC1000) mounted on board realizes the CTRL LAN and PERIPH LAN communications via Ethernet. The FPGA (IC1800) controls the switches, LEDs, and LCD monitors of the panel that are connected to the MAIN PANEL, MENU PANEL, and EXT PANEL terminals. The three PLDs (IC701, IC1603, IC2501) control the devices on the control panel and the FP-141 board. The DC-DC converter on the CA-57 board generates the power supply voltages +5 V, +3.3 V and +1.5 V used in the CA-57 board, +5 V supplied to the MPU-302B board, and the ATX power supply voltages 5 V_ATX and 3.3 V_ATX.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
