{"path":"To Be Organized/30 Rock Global Infrastructure/Dante/Dante Logs.docx","text":"How to look through Dante Logs for Network issues This guide is for when you may find issues with RTS panels dropping off the network and losing connectivity. When this happens you may find no errors occurring in the ACI APIC environment but this does not mean there was no network issue. This is useful to know when troubleshooting any type of Dante issue, not just for RTS but for the sake of this guide I will be using RTS issues as the main point to cover. You will need to know which Dante Controller you are working with. To view all the Dante Controllers, open RDM and open the Audio Tab. Then open the CR you are working with. In this case we had issues with CR76 RTS panels. Open the Controller that you need to get logs off of. In this case it was CR74 and 76 ICM Dante. Typically these controllers are not shared but given the type of CR 74/76 is we are shared here. In the Dante Controller application, select Events. This is the Log Viewer. You can use this section to determine if there are any network issues with this card. In the case of 76 RTS panels going down, the clue in the logs that we were having issues was different cards elevating themselves to the primary leader card, without another card dying in order to trigger this. The symptom of this behavior was loss of all RTS panels for a few minutes before they come back on their own, because the cards were passing leadership between themselves.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
