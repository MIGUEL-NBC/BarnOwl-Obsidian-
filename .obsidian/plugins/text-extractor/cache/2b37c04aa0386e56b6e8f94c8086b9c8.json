In Lawo systems, HOME defines all of the network routing required for control and streaming. Thus, it configures the management network connections and sending/receiving streams between any two registered devices. All settings are adjusted using the HOME Web UI. This is accessed by entering the IP address of the HOME server into a web browser and then signing in. The computer you use must be part of the same network and subnet as the HOME server. The HOME Web UI has four main pages: Devices - lists all devices known to HOME. From here you can label a device, define its network ports and configure its senders and receivers (visible in Stream Routing). Stream Routing - manages the streaming connections. From here you can connect a sender to a receiver, or interrogate the existing connections. Snapshots - lists the system snapshots. Snapshots can be used to create a backup of the complete configuration (i.e. all devices and stream routing). Settings - provides access to more advanced settings. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - First Steps –  11 • • • • • • • • 2 HOME - First Steps 2.1 Prerequisites All Lawo systems come with HOME pre-installed onto a suitable host server platform. In most cases, this platform is a server cluster consisting of 3 single servers. In some cases, HOME is shipping pre-installed as a single instance on the mc² Gateserver. Whether the host server platform is a cluster, or a device that is included with the system hardware, is dependent on the product and its integration. The HOME server must be correctly installed and connected to the network. Then, you can use HOME to connect devices that you wish to manage. 2.2 Computer / Browser Requirements A connection to HOME can be opened from a service computer connected to the same network as the HOME server. To run the Web UI, your computer MUST meet or exceed the following requirements: CPU: Intel i3 or higher RAM: 64 MB Network Interface Card: operating at 100 or 1000 Base-T Screen Resolution: >= 1024 x 786 (FullHD is recommended) Web Browser: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Apple Safari or Mozilla Firefox. Please install the latest version of the browser for best performance. For best user experience, we recommend to run HOME in a browser as used in Lawo's labs (e.g. Google Chrome v100.x or higher). 2.3 Opening the HOME Web UI Follow the steps below to open a web UI session. 2.3.1 1. Connect your computer's LAN port to the network. 2.3.2 2. Configure the network settings for your computer's Network Interface Card (NIC). The IP address must be unique, and set within the same range as that of the HOME servers management NIC(s). The subnet masks should be identical. A default gateway is required if data packets are to be redirected. For example, if you are connecting via a network switch with Layer 3 routing capability. If redirection is not required, then the default gateway can be left blank. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - First Steps –  12 • • 2.3.3 3. Open your web browser application and type in either http:// IP address:5000 / or the domain name of the HOME server, followed by port :5000 . 2.3.4 4. Press Enter. Following a successful connection, the \"Sign in” screen appears. 2.3.5 5. Enter the Username and Password as follows: Username = admin Password = password 2.3.6 6. Click on the Sign In button. Following a successful sign in, the HOME “Devices” page appears. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - First Steps –  13 • • • • • • 2.4 Troubleshooting Q: Why does the “Sign in” screen not appear? A: If the “Sign in” screen does not appear, then there is a problem with the network communication to the HOME server. Check that the HOME server is powered and connected to the network. Check that your web browser meets the system requirements. If in doubt, try a different browser. Check the network cabling and IP settings of the computer’s LAN port and HOME server. Q: Why do I see the message “401 Authorization Required” after signing in? A: This message appears if the sign in process fails. Re-fresh your browser to return to the “Sign in” screen. Enter the correct Username and Password, and click on Sign In. The Username and Password are case sensitive. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - User Management –  14 • • 3 HOME - User Management To access the HOME Web UI, you must be signed in as a user. In the current release, HOME supports a single user (admin). There is no way to change the user password and so you must sign in using the following credentials: Username = admin Password = password Following a successful sign in, the admin user has full access to all of HOME’s pages and functions. In subsequent releases, it is planned to expand the user management system. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Operating Principles –  15 • • • • • • 4 HOME - Operating Principles This section describes how to use the HOME Web UI. HOME - Web UI Overview(see page 15) HOME - Page Navigation(see page 16) HOME - Sorting Lists(see page 17) HOME - Making Selections(see page 18) HOME - Using Filters(see page 20) HOME - Saving Settings(see page 26) 4.1 HOME - Web UI Overview The Web UI always opens with the “Devices” page. All pages use the same operating principles and are divided into the following areas. Full-width screens 1. LAWO Logo – click to view information about the UI version and to get directed to the logging and debug screens. 2. Page Menu – click to open a different page. 3. Working Area – displays the page name and any filters (3a), all available functions (3b) and the page contents (3c). 4. Light (or Dark) Mode - click to toggle the view between light and dark mode. If the screen width is reduced, then there is no side bar showing the available pages. Instead, a drop-down page menu appears (2) beside the LAWO logo (1). Reduced-width screens (< 1440 pixels) HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Operating Principles –  16 4.2 HOME - Page Navigation You can navigate to a different page by clicking on an option in the sidebar or drop-down menu. Sidebar page menu (full-width screens) Drop-down page menu (reduced-width screens) HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Operating Principles –  17 • • • • The HOME Web UI has four main pages: Devices - lists all devices known to HOME. From here you can label a device, define its network ports and configure its senders and receivers (visible in Stream Routing). Stream Routing - manages the streaming connections. From here you can connect a sender to a receiver, or interrogate the existing connections. Snapshots - lists the system snapshots. Snapshots can be used to create a backup of the complete configuration (i.e. all devices and stream routing). Settings - provides access to more advanced settings. Most of the work is done in the first two pages: \"Devices(see page 27)\" and \"Stream Routing(see page 68)\". 4.3 HOME - Sorting Lists If the page contents are listed in a table, then the header row describes each column. Click on a column header to sort the table alphabetically (e.g. by Label). Each click toggles the sort mode between ascending (A -> Z) and descending (Z -> A). An up or down arrow appears beside the header to indicate the current sort mode. Sort by Label HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Operating Principles –  18 4.4 HOME - Making Selections In order to unlock some functions, you must first select an entry in the table. For example, to Quarantine or Reboot a device (in the \"Devices\" page). Each row can be selected (or deselected) by clicking on the checkbox in the first column. Selected rows are highlighted in blue, with a blue tick in the checkbox. Single device selected You can select more than one row by clicking on several checkboxes. Multiple devices selected HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Operating Principles –  19 To select (or deselect) all rows, click on the checkbox in the header row. All devices selected This allows you to work in reverse by selecting all devices and then editing the selections. Multiple devices selected HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Operating Principles –  20 • 4.5 HOME - Using Filters The Filters button can be used to filter the contents of a table. For example, to view only the devices in a particular location (in the \"Devices\" page), or only sources and destinations of a particular type (in the \"Stream Routing(see page 68)\" or \"I/O Routing(see page 48)\" pages). 4.5.1 Applying a Filter 4.5.1.1 1.

The data is stored on the HOME server. If the server restarts, then the configuration is re-instated at the end of the reboot. If a networked device restarts, or is disconnected, then any streaming connections to and from the device are lost. However, the connections are still prepared. This means that as soon as the device comes back online, its streaming connections are re-established. If you wish to make a backup of a particular point in the setup, then you can save the complete configuration in a snapshot. For more information on how to do this, see HOME - Snapshots.(see page 73) HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Devices –  27 • • • • • 5 HOME - Devices The \"Devices\" page lists all devices known to HOME. A device must appear here before it can be configured. All Lawo IP nodes and such devices which \"live@HOME\" as native HOME nodes are discovered automatically when they are connected to the network. Devices that are compatible with NMOS IS-04/IS-05 can be discovered automatically, too, if HOME is running with a valid NMOS license. Third-party devices that are not detected can be added manually by configuring a proxy. An example is included later(see page 76). \"Devices\" List (example) 5.1 Device Information The following information is displayed for each HOME naticedevice known to HOME: Label - identifies the device to other network users. The label field must be completed and cannot be left blank. All automatically-detected devices are assigned a default label.

The Primary Multicast, Secondary Multicast and Destination UDP Port fields determine how the multicast addresses are created. There are two possibilities: either automatic or manual. If you leave the fields at their default values (auto and 5004), then the stream will be allocated an automatic multicast IP address and port. In most instances, this is fine. You can view the allocated addresses once the stream is created (by selecting the stream and clicking on Parameters(see page 54)). If your network supports a limited IP range, then you may wish to assign a multicast IP address and port manually. In this instance, type the required values into the corresponding fields. The stream size is defined by the number of channels, codec type and frame size. This is important if network bandwidth is an issue. Thus, the network topology should be considered before defining the channel count for senders and receivers.  You can use double braces to enter an auto-incrementing range. For example, when creating 8-channel streams. you could type Tx {{1-8}} to enter the sender labels: Tx 1-8, Tx 9-16, Tx 17-24, etc.  The Sender Label identifies the stream to other network users. It cannot be left blank and cannot be edited once you have created the stream. The identifier string must not contain the character “/” (ASCII/UTF-8: 47) and must begin with a letter or the lower line character “a”-“z”, “A”-“Z”, “_” (ASCII/UTF-8: 65-90, 97-122 ,95).

Once an incoming stream is connected, if there is a mismatch, then the incoming channels are received on a best-effort basis. For example: If a stereo stream is connected to an 8-channel receiver, then the two source channels are assigned to channels 1 and 2 of the receiver (and channels 3 to 8 of the receiver are unused). If a 64-channel stream is connected to an 8-channel receiver, then the first eight source channels are assigned to channels 1 to 8 of the receiver (and the remaining source channels from the incoming stream are unused).  HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  47 6.6.4.4 4.

The method for receivers is identical (but select the Receivers tab). 1. From the Senders tab, select a stream and click on SDP. The \"SDP Data\" window opens. Note that the SDP button is not available if you select more than one sender. SDP (Session Description Protocol) is a format for describing streaming media communication parameters. It is commonly used in standard networking applications.  HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  56 • • • The main area shows the SDP information for the stream. Or, for the connected stream if you are viewing the SDP of a receiver. If the stream is redundant, the SDP contains information about both network paths. 6.6.7.2 SDP Operations The following operations are possible. Copy to clipboard - copies the SDP data to the clipboard. You can use this to set up a streaming connection (as described below). Write SDP Data - if you click anywhere inside the main area, then it is possible to edit the SDP data. To save the changes, click on Write SDP Data. This can be used to edit the SDP manually, or via a copy & paste (as described below). Cancel - closes the SDP data window without saving. 6.6.7.3 Setting Up a Streaming Connection The SDP data can be used to set up a fixed streaming connection between a specific sender and receiver. This method can be used as an alternative to the Stream Routing(see page 68) page. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  57 1. Start by creating a new receiver in the usual manner. The receiver parameters should match (or exceed) those of the incoming stream. e.g. same channel count, redundancy mode, etc. 2. Copy the SDP information from the sender. If the device is known to HOME, then you can open the SDP data (as described above) and select Copy to clipboard. If the device is not known to HOME, then you will need to obtain the SDP data using another method (e.g. via the device's own Web UI). 3. Return to the receiver created in step 1, and open its SDP data. The SDP data should be empty (as this is a new receiver). Important: If you use this method, then the streaming connection is not shown in the \" Stream Routing(see page 68)\". In this instance, it is important not to make another connection to the same receiver. Connecting more than one stream to the same receiver can lead to strange results!  HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  58 4. Click anywhere inside the main area and paste the contents of the clipboard (press CTRL+V, or right-click and select Paste). 5. Click on Write SDP Data to save the changes and exit.

When creating a new sender, most of the parameters are hidden from view until you reveal the Advanced Settings. The parameters are explained in the order that they appear in the \"Edit Audio Sender\" window. The \"Label\", \"Streaming Interface\", \"Protection\" and \"Channels\" fields cannot be modified once a stream is created.  HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  60 • • • 6.6.8.1 Label The Sender Label identifies the stream to other network users. It cannot be left blank and cannot be edited once you have created the stream. The identifier string must not contain the character “/” (ASCII/UTF-8: 47) and must begin with a letter or the lower line character “a”-“z”, “A”-“Z”, “_” (ASCII/UTF-8: 65-90, 97-122 ,95). Sender labels must not exceed 28 characters. 6.6.8.2 Streaming Interface & Protection These fields determine which interface, or interfaces, will be used to transmit the stream to the network. To create SMPTE ST2022-7 compatible streams, the \"Protection\" field must be set to Dual Redundant to activate both interfaces. If redundant streaming is not required, then you can choose to issue the stream from either the Primary or Secondary interface. 6.6.8.3 Channels This value sets the number of audio channels to be encoded. 6.6.8.4 Frame Size (Packet Time) The frame size sets the number of samples per channel per network packet, and defines the packet time (in seconds). The default value = 6 samples / 125 µs. The smaller the value, the more often the device transmits packets. This results in a lower sending latency, but also a higher demand on the network's bandwidth. In Lawo devices, the frame size limits the number of senders that can be created by each device. 6.6.8.5 Codec This field selects the encoding method used for the digital audio. There are three possible options. The default value = L24. L16 = 16-bit Linear PCM L24 = 24-bit Linear PCM AM824 = 24-bit Linear PCM + 8-bit metadata, a non-standard format commonly used in AES/EBU. 6.6.8.6 TTL (Time to Leave) The TTL value can be used to prevent data packets from circulating indefinitely. The default value = 16. You may need to increase the TTL value if your network includes several Layer 3 network switches (Gateways). HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  61 6.6.8.7 RTP Payload Type This field describes the format of the transported content. The default value = 98. 6.6.8.8 Primary / Secondary Multicast Address & Destination UDP Port These fields show the multicast IP addresses and UDP port assigned to the stream. By default, when you create a new stream, the multicast addresses are assigned automatically and the UDP port value is set to 5004. If you wish to assign a multicast IP address and port manually, then type the required values into the corresponding fields. 6.6.8.9 Primary / Secondary Source Address These fields are for information only. They show the IP address of the multicast address provider (used in auto mode). 6.6.9 HOME - Receiver Parameters The following parameters appear when you edit(see page 54) an existing receiver or create a new (see page 42)receiver(see page 45). When creating a new receiver, most of the parameters are hidden from view until you reveal the Advanced Settings. The parameters are explained in the order that they appear in the \"Edit Audio Receiver\" window. The \"Label\", \"Streaming Interface\", \"Protection\" and \"Max Receivable Channels\" fields cannot be modified once a receiver is created.  HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  62 6.6.9.1 Label The Receiver Label identifies the receiver within the network. It cannot be left blank and cannot be edited once you have created the receiver. The identifier string must not contain the character “/” (ASCII/UTF-8: 47) and must begin with a letter or the lower line character “a”-“z”, “A”-“Z”, “_” (ASCII/UTF-8: 65-90, 97-122 ,95). Receiver labels must not exceed 28 characters. 6.6.9.2 Streaming Interface & Protection These fields determine which interface, or interfaces, will be used to receive the connected stream from the network. By default, all new receivers are configured to use two network ports in Dual Redundant mode so that they can accept two SMPTE ST2022-7 compatible streams (for redundant streaming). You can choose to receive these streams non-redundantly by choosing either Primary Only or Secondary Only. If the connected stream's SDP is not SMPTE ST2022-7 compatible, then the \"Protection\" field is set to Primary Only (by default). In this instance, you can change the receiver port to Secondary Only if needed. HOME - Media Infrastructure Management  –  HOME - User Documentation HOME - Device Details –  63 • • 6.6.9.3 Max Receivable Channels This value sets the maximum number of channels that can be received. Once an incoming stream is connected, if there is a mismatch, then the incoming channels are received on a best-effort basis. For example: If a stereo stream is connected to an 8-channel receiver, then only the first two channels of the receiver are used. If a 64-channel stream is connected to an 8-channel receiver, then channels 1 to 8 are assigned to the receiver and channels 9 to 64 are unused. 6.6.9.4 Syntonized This option determines whether the receiver runs in syntonized mode (option enabled) or synchronized mode (option disabled). By default, syntonized mode is enabled. Syntonized mode should be used if the clock signal is missing from the connected stream's SDP information, or if you have a different clock source selected at the sender and receiver. It should always be enabled for connections between Lawo audio and video devices. Synchronized mode can be used if .... 6.6.9.5 Delay Relative to Source Timestamp (samples) This value can be used to compensate for delays along the network path such as packetization latency and jitter. The default value = 12 samples. The value must always be larger than the frame size (in samples) specified at the sender. As a general rule, set the value to 2 x the sender's frame size. If you experience drop-outs during playback, then increase the value.  6.6.9.6 Current Stream Information The remaining fields provide information about the connected stream (once a connection is made). The fields are identical to those for a sender, see Sender Parameters(see page 59). 6.7 HOME - Device -> I/O Routing The I/O Routing tab appears for all devices that support audio inputs and outputs. It is used to connect the IP channels of the senders and receivers to the physical audio I/Os of the device: Mic/Line, AES3, MADI, etc. The operation is the same as described previously for senders and receivers. See I/O Routing(see page 48). 6.8 HOME - Device -> GPI & GPO The GPI and GPO tabs appear for all devices that support General Purpose Inputs and Outputs.

It defines all of the network routing required for control and streaming. HOME is responsible for configuring the management network connections, and sending/receiving streams, between any two registered devices. Devices can include any Lawo IP node and third-party devices compatible with NMOS IS-04/IS-05.  The complete setup is handled by a web-based UI. The HOME web UI has four main pages: Devices - lists all of the devices known to HOME. From here you can label a device, define its network ports and configure its senders and receivers (visible in the Stream Routing). Stream Routing - lists all of the available senders and receivers. From here you can connect a sender to a receiver, either at a stream level or individual channel level. Snapshots - lists the available snapshots. From here you can make a backup of the current configuration. Snapshots should be used with caution as they store and recall the complete configuration (i.e. all devices and stream routing). Settings - opens a list of sub-menus for more advanced settings. In the first release, there is a single level of user access. Once a user is logged in (as administrator), they have access to all of HOME's pages and functions. In subsequent releases, it is planned to expand the user levels to restrict access to certain functions. One of the aims of HOME is to keep the network secure. Whenever a new device is detected, it is automatically placed in quarantine and the Web UI alerts the user to take action. The next steps are to check the device's network ports (to avoid duplicate IP addresses) and then approve the device (to add it to the operational network). All Lawo and NMOS devices are discovered automatically when they are connected to the network.  Third-party devices that are not automatically detected by HOME can be added manually to the Device list (by configuring a proxy).
