{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Studio Maintenance - Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Dali/Dali.docx","text":"Dali Dali is used by producers to order graphics and insert them into Viz Pilot templates, and then iNews. There is a Dali Website that producers and artists use to make and complete orders, and the Dali Plugin, which they use to drag images into Viz Pilot. You cannot drag and drop from the website. Dali user account creation, password resets, etc. are handled by the Dali Admin group. You can reach dali administrators via the outlook group @NBC UNI Dali Admins. I would contact Rob Dayrit and Rich Tallmidge with issues. If Dali is not loading, it may need to be updated or reinstalled. This is handled by the News IT Helpdesk, x4161. If dragging and dropping is extremely slow or is not working, restart the Graphics Hub REST service. VizGHRest - 100.113.83.96 On the remote machine, click start and type Services, then find Viz GH Rest Service, right click to Stop, and then right click to Start. If the issue persists, escalate to Dali admins.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
