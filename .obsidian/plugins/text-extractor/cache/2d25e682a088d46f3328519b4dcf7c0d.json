With direct conversion of up to 18 SD/HD/3G signals to IP using SMPTE2022-6 formatting the 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 series delivers unparalleled processing densities. Additionally, it also supports up to 2 audio TDM ports for carrying discrete audio over IP in addition to the primary video. With functionality such as integrated frame sync and retiming on the SDI output stage, the 570IPG is really the only platform that will deliver SMPTE2022-6 compliance today and is also architected in the data path layer to support future SMPTE2022 series encapsulation and formatting methodologies. The 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 also provides per input AVM monitoring, auto timing, time stamped Ethernet outputs. The 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 series modules incorporates patent pending multipath, multi-ﬂ ow packet merge base network bit error resilience for 100% QoS. 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 can be managed via Integrated HTTP web interface as well as SNMP management via Frame Controller. 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 SDI Video Demux Active Picture Video over IP MUX Per Signal IP TX Encapsulation Per Signal IP TX Encapsulation CPU 1588-PTP Timing Recovery Video over IP De- MUX IP RX Multi-Path Packet Merge Frame Buffer 18 10GE- SFP+ Cage 18 10GE- SFP+ Cage SDI Video Mux 10GE Pair 1 Per Signal IP TX Encapsulation Per Signal IP TX Encapsulation IP RX Multi-Path Packet Merge 10GE- SFP+ Cage 10GE- SFP+ Cage 10GE Pair 2 Per Signal IP TX Encapsulation Per Signal IP TX Encapsulation IP RX Multi-Path Packet Merge 10GE- SFP+ Cage 10GE- SFP+ Cage 10GE Pair 6 Video Input/ Output Dynamic Coax to/from IP Port And IP in to output loop back Mapping 18 18 2 18 2 Audio VANC Active Picture Audio VANC Audio TDM Output Inband Control (SNMP, HTTP) Frame Genlock Frame Control Buss Per Port Input / Output Direction Selector VCXO 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G TDM, 1588-PTP 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G TDM, 1588-PTP 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G 18xSD, 6xHD, 3x3G TDM, 1588-PTP 3G/HD/SD Audio TDM 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 Hybrid Baseband/Ethernet Infrastructure – Media Gateway Evertz Conﬁ dential and Protected Under NDA CONFIDENTIAL TO NBCU Rev. 16-2 Speciﬁ cations Serial Digital Video: Standards: SMPTE 424M (3Gb/s), SMPTE 292M (1.5Gb/s), SMPTE 259M (270Mb/s) Serial Video Input: Number of Inputs: 18 Connector: DIN 1.0/2.3 Input Equalization: Automatic to 100m @ 3 Gb/s, 150m @1.5 Gb/s & 350m @ 270 Mb/s Return Loss: >12dB up to .5 GHz, >10dB up to 3GHz Serial Video Output: Number of Outputs: 18* (ports shared with inputs) Rise and Fall Time: Per SMPTE spec TDM: Number of Outputs 2 Connector: DIN 1.0/2.3 Ethernet Interface: 12 x 10GE SFP+ Video Encapsulation: SMPTE2022-6 or Video, Audio (302M), VANC(2038) in TS/PAT/ PMT over IP Data Format: Ethernet/IP/UDP Control Signaling: SDN or IGMP V2/V3 (SSM Support) Electrical: Power: 90 W Voltage: 12VDC EMI/RFI: Complies with FCC Part 15, Class AEU EMC directive Physical (number of slots): HD/SD: 2 3G: 3 Enclosures: 570FR: 15 slot 3RU chassis 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 Hybrid Baseband/Ethernet Infrastructure – Media Gateway PTP Source 5601MSC+PTP Ordering Information 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 Hybrid Baseband/Ethernet Infrastructure – Media Gateway Evertz Conﬁ dential and Protected Under NDA 570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 Front 570FR - Front 570FR - Rear570IPG-3G18-SFPP12 Rear CONFIDENTIAL TO NBCU","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
