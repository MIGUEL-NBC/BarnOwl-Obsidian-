This seems be caused by a communication breakdown between the Sony DCU and DNF GTP-v1 which eventually connects to the Evertz DreamCatcher. By restarting the 2x DNF GTP-v1 and the DreamCatcher AMP service, the issue can be averted for 18-36 hours. This process has been completed daily before operations arrives to prevent the issue from causing on-air impacts. Procedure: 1. Access the vueweb shortcut for the DreamCatcher serving Gold and Silver (100.103.244.175/vueweb). The username and password are “DMCR-075A” for both fields if prompted. 2. Navigate to the services page and the “dcsamp” service which should look like the below image. 3. Click the toggle next the “Enable DCSAMP” which will cause a prompt to appear at the service title bar.
