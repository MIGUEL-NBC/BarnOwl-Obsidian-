While an SDI coax system typically carries one signal, a 10G Ethernet link can carry multiple streams and it can be difficult to determine what content is carried on each of the streams within a IP based broadcast system. PRISM offers a range of tools to quickly identify the streams in the 10G Ethernet link and the content in each stream. The IP Status application shows the source IP address and port number, destination IP address and port number, and protocol of all streams available in an incoming 10G Ethernet link. IP Status application showing all streams in a 10G Ethernet link. An engineer can view further details using the Video tab in the IP Session application, which shows the RTP header information in the selected ST2022-6 stream including High Bit Rate Media header information with Green / Red LED error status. The status LED on an application tab indicates the aggregated error status for the monitored items under that tab. An engineer can determine the number of streams available on the link as well as the quality level of each stream. A selected stream can be decoded to the Picture application to let the engineer verify the content in the stream, and can also be output through the AUX SDI output with IP/SDI conversion for the extensive monitoring solution. IP Session application showing the RTP header information including HBRMT in ST2022-6 streams in a ST2022-7 configuration. Monitor and verify PTP system setup to ensure genlock of equipment in the facility In a hybrid IP/SDI broadcast system, a variety of reference signals may be used to synchronize equipment within the facility. Traditionally, black burst (BB) or tri-level sync (TLS) references have been used for this purpose. For IP networks, PTP (IEEE1588) is used for system synchronization. PTP uses mechanisms for accurate synchronization, higher system robustness and further flexibility in the system integration. For example, the Best Master Clock Algorithm (BMCA) is used to determine the grandmaster. Another example is the communication model to choose the message transport model to convey the time stamps. However, those mechanisms work as designed only when engineers have set up the system correctly. In the IP Status application, PRISM displays the PTP traffic available in the 10G Ethernet link to let users quickly check for the presence of PTP messages. The PTP tab in the IP Session application provides the lock status, including the phase lag to the grandmaster, and interpretation of the PTP metadata within the Announce Message. The PTP metadata includes the Master ID, PTP time in UTC and master characteristics (clock quality, priority, etc.) to let the engineer ensure the setting of the PTP system is correct. IP Session application showing the PTP lock status and PTP information. In the PTP Graphs application, PRISM plots the network delay and network delay variation. The network delay and network delay variation plots are available for both signal directions on the network, Master to Slave (Tms) and Slave to Master (Tsm). The network delay values are calculated directly from the PTP message time stamps, while the variation numbers are calculated from the delay as per RFC1889. The phase lag is the filtered difference Tsm-Tms, and is used to adjust the local PTP clock. Therefore, as PRISM locks to the PTP master unit, it will adjust to minimize the phase lag and make Tsm and Tms equal. The PTP graphs show the effects of both network delay and adjustments to the slave unit timing. However, since the contribution from the adjustment is low after establishing a lock to the PTP master unit, the PTP network delay becomes dominant in the graphs. In the ideal PTP system, Tms / Tsm network delay should be constant and identical. The variations in real applications, however, may impact the PTP lock process in the slave unit and could cause a PTP unlock situation if they are excessive. PRISM Datasheet 2 www.tek.com The PTP graphs allow the detection of adverse network conditions, such as too much traffic on the PTP ports. Master-Slave Delay and Master-Slave Variation graphs. Facility timing made easy The importance of timing adjustment in an IP broadcast facility is unchanged. As the alignment mechanism uses the timestamp in the streams, correct time stamping at the source device is important. The variance of transmission time at the mixing point, such as a production switcher, needs to be less than the buffer size chosen for the minimum latency. The Tektronix-patented Timing application makes facility timing easy through a simple graphical representation, which shows the relative timing of the SMPTE 2022-6 stream and the PTP reference on an X-Y axis and visualizes the one-dimensional time delay in terms of the picture parameters. This allows timing adjustment in units of lines and microseconds. Path 1 and Path 2 timing against the PTP reference. Since ST 2022-6 streams are complete SDI signals encapsulated in IP, the timing measurement treats these IP signals as if they were SDI. Therefore, the timing system detects the start of the IP frame, and then extrapolates to the 0h point of the encapsulated SDI. Then using PTP as the reference, the ideal alignment point for that frame rate is calculated based on the PTP epoch. Finally, the offset between the ST 2022-6 signal and the ideal alignment is displayed. The display shows both the absolute time and the time parsed into lines or horizontal delay as time and pixels. One use for the Timing application is to measure the delay in a gateway and network. If a properly timed SDI signal is applied to a gateway, then the timing measurement on the resulting IP flow will display the combined latency in the gateway and the network. Another use is to measure multiple signals and compare the relative timing. Monitor the quality level to keep the facility on air The asynchronous nature of an IP system can produce a wide variety of bandwidth usage; in extreme cases this can result in the loss of packets. Therefore it is important to be able to monitor the network traffic and engineers need tools to evaluate packet loss. PRISM provides a Packet Interval Time (PIT) histogram and trend graph as well as the trend graph of Time Stamped Delay Factor (TS-DF) standardized in EBU-TECH 3337 to help engineers determine how the packet interarrival time from a sender is affected in the system. These measurements can help engineers determine the root cause when packet loss has occurred. PIT Histogram application for monitoring the range of PIT variance. PIT trend graph for monitoring the trend of PIT variance over time. PRISM Datasheet www.tek.com 3 TS-DF trend graph for monitoring the trend of TS-DF variance over time. Debug a hybrid IP/SDI broadcast system to isolate the root cause Engineers debugging a hybrid IP/SDI system first need to isolate the root cause of the error to find whether the error is in the IP layer or in the content layer. Details of the error can then be determined by examining the identified layer. PRISM offers error detection feature sets in both the IP and content layers using the Event Log application. The graphical displays show the error trend correlated to historical data. In these displays, the errors detected in both IP and content layers are time correlated, which allows the engineer to verify the error in the IP or content layer. For example, if an error is detected in the content layer but not in the IP layer, then the error may have happened before the content was wrapped by the IP headers. RTP Sequence Error incident graph for monitoring the errors detected over time. Event Log application for checking the details of error events. SMPTE 2022-7 monitoring for robust IP broadcast operation For broadcasters that are committed to their clients, ensuring 24/7 quality broadcasting is a minimum requirement. SMPTE 2022-7 was standardized to build and operate a redundant IP system for broadcasters. PRISM provides the broadcast engineers a monitoring solution to properly setup the redundant system. When an input configured with SMPTE 2022-7 enabled is selected, the difference in the receive time of datagrams on path number 1 / 2 is monitored to help engineers determine the signal path and buffer setting in the receiver. PRISM also offers packet header interpretation and error detection for the two paths simultaneously. The reconstructed output stream is fed to the content layer applications, such as Picture and Waveform, and to the AUX SDI output. Path 1 – Path 2 Delay graph. A positive number indicates that Path 2 arrived first and a negative number indicates that Path 1 arrived first. Monitor the quality of content with familiar feature sets In any broadcasting system, ensuring the quality of Video and Audio is the most important task for broadcast engineers. The Picture, Waveform, Audio and Video Session applications are available for engineers who need the familiar feature sets to instantly check the quality of content. Picture, Waveform, Audio, and Video Session applications provide content conformance monitoring tools. PRISM Datasheet 4 www.tek.com Operate PRISM remotely to provide immediate facility assistance Within a hybrid IP/SDI facility, there are a wide variety of tasks an engineer needs to perform to troubleshoot issues. One such task is to quickly provide assistance to an operator to help meet a deadline for production or to keep the facility on-air. The remote control feature in PRISM allows the engineer to remotely access the unit with a Web browser application running on a PC or tablet computer. This allows the engineer to immediately provide assistance by starting to diagnose the problem from their desk, minimizing down time, and helping to isolate the cause of the problem. Remote monitoring using a Web browser. Control PRISM from system management software Operators in SDI facilities have used SDI router control panels to select the SDI source to monitor on a waveform monitor. In an SDI/IP hybrid facility, the system integrators prepare the same capability for the operators. This requires system management software to send commands to end point equipment so they can subscribe to streams through IGMP V3. The PRISM API allows system integrators to build an IP system with PRISM being managed by system management software. The API enables operators to remotely configure inputs and to select the active input. Example API commands Function Mode /api/configureInput GET /api/configureInput POST /api/activeInput GET /api/activeInput POST /api/help GET Easy offline analysis with 10G Ethernet packet capture When engineers require detailed analysis with an offline tool, the IP capture feature in PRISM allows them to quickly access the stream they need to analyze. The 2 GB capture capability can create a pcap file of up to 1.6 seconds at 10 Gbps. Capture settings menu. Flexible installation options PRISM offers two platform options: 3RU half-rack width (MPI) and 1RU full- rack width (MPX). The MPI platform with the optional portable cabinet allows users to move the unit between different locations. The MPI platform with the optional rack mount kits allows users to install the unit in an equipment rack. The MPX platform is intended for applications where space in an equipment rack needs to be minimized, for applications where an external touch panel display is going to be used, for KVM operation or for applications where remote monitoring is preferred.
