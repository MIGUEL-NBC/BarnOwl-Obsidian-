{"path":"Referenced Material/PDF Library/Vendor/SOPs/Dreamcatcher/SOP_PlayoutPTPCheck_v2.pdf","text":"1 | P a g e Objective/Purpose: This document describes the process to the PTP lock status of a DreamCatcher Playout Server (DC- Playout). The IP addresses can be found at https://nbcuni.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/GFXTechnology/EZcv_WlSloVEiCkgqNOV_tcBOWhN0zBu6E1eQ3RYj QVYCw?e=c2etsx but channel assignments can change as the system is fully routable. Always check Magnum SDVN or a control room “far” UMD to confirm the physical playout device that is feeding a CR DDR. Procedure: 1. Open Putty or mtPutty and enter the appropriate address from the spreadsheet linked above. Credentials are ‘etservice’ for username and ‘dcshdtv’ for password. 2. Copy and paste or type the command on the next line into the Putty session - a. “tail -f /var/log/mvproxy.log” 3. The log should add a line approximately every second. A healthy entry would have 3 lines, a PTP status and the bandwidth for each SFP. a. Unhealthy entries look like the below with “Faulty Master” or “state Listening” and the server should be restarted at the next opportunity. NOTE: playout may still be smooth if the state is listening but may begin to break up without warning.
