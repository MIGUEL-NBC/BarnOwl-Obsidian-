When Windows Firewall is enabled in Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 R2, or Windows Server 2012 R2, the following MOS Gateway services must be added to the Windows Firewall exception list: • MosRouterService.exe - MosRoStorySendService.exe - • MosReplicationService.exe - MosAdminService.exe -. • MosGatewayLogger.exe • MosConfigService.exe - • RegRGS.exe - • regtlb.exe - • TraceLogService.exe - Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 16 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.3.1 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.3.1. • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, the required objType & objTB tags were missing in mosObjCreate message. This is fixed. IN-2043 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.3.0 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.3.0. • A new device option <ShortRoID> has been added. If you have the line <ShortRoID>YES</ShortRoID> in the Devices section of the mosconfig.xml configuration file, then MOS Gateway will use the last portion of the rundown name as RoID. If another rundown has the same short name already loaded, a number will be appended to differentiate the rundowns. The default for this option is NO. IN-1664 • A new device option <ReplicateData> has been added to the Devices section of the mosconfig.xml configuration file. If the Devices section has the option <ReplicateData>YES</ReplicateData>, then <objType>, <objTB>, <objDur>, <itemEdStart>, <itemEdDur> in the item will be replicated to <mosPayload> in <mosExternalMetaData>. The default for this option is NO. IN-1665 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.2.1 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.2.1. • In previous 4.x versions of MOS Gateway, intermittent failures of the MOS Router Service occurred. This has been fixed. IN-1447 • In previous versions, long rundowns could result in excessive logging and cause MOS Gateway to hang up. New <LoggingLevel>are added to <logging> to address the issue with 0x10 -> enable logging of XML messages to MOS devices 0x20-> enable logging of XML messages from MOS devices 0x80-> enable of error messages from replication services 0x03- errors & warnings and 1 liner information, and all messaging is enabled by default. This is fixed. IN-1555 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.2.0 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.2.0. • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, deleting of unassigned placeholder from a MOS device would change the status of that item to DELETED in the Replication queue in iNEWS instead of actually removing the item from the queue as expected. This has been fixed, so that now deletions on the device are correctly reflected in the Replication queue on iNEWS. IN-1076 • In previous version of mos gateway \"replicate\" and \"clear\" buttons of Mos Admin application didn't work as should. This is fixed. IN-1028 • In this version of MOS Gateway, the duration is extracted, if available from the mosObj, and displayed in the MOS-DURATION field for stories in the Replication queue on iNEWS. Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 17 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.1.0 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.1.0. • This version of MOS Gateway has a new per device setting GetMosDuration. When set to “yes” and replication for the device is set up, the updated duration will be saved in the replication service’s cache. The saved duration will be sent to update an event whenever there is a status change. The default for the setting is No. This new setting is to provide a way to update duration for devices that do not support mosItemReplace. Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.0.2 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.0.2. • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, a multithreaded message between iNEWS and MOS Gateway might get inadvertently overwritten, which corrupts the stream and breaks the connection between the monitor server and MOS. This is fixed. Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.0.1 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.0.1. • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, if text update and delete of the same story is received from iNEWS at the same time, it might send the text update after the delete to the device. This is fixed. Hardware and Software Changes for Version 4.0 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 4.0. • There is new variable support in the mosconfig.xml under <mosDevice>, <AllowMosObjCreate>YES</AllowMosObjCreate> Default value is NO. You need to set it to YES to enable MOS Gateway to ask third-party devices for the ID for any mosObjCreate items. • iNEWS v4.0 now lets users insert MOS object placeholders within iNEWS stories in either the story form or as a story’s production cue. The procedures for doing so are as follows: To insert a MOS object placeholder: 1. Right-click while mouse pointer is either in the Story Form panel or in the Story Text panel. 2. Select Insert Placeholder. 3. Select the MOS device. Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 18 4. Enter a new slug or use the default. 5. (Optional) Enter a description. 6. Click OK. If you right-clicked in the Story Form panel, the new MOS object placeholder appears in the story form. If you right-clicked in the Story Text panel, the new MOS object placeholder appears as a production cue in the Instruction panel. Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 19 The MOS device user can update the placeholder with a real ID and object by turning on or loading the monitor server. MOS Gateway will then return data back to iNEWS where the placeholder is located in either the story form (below at left) or product cue (below at right). • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, mosconfig.xsl incorrectly identified the \"mossvr\" SYSTEM.MAP line as \"mossrv.\" This is fixed. Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 20 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 3.1.0 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 3.1.0. Installation • In previous versions of iNEWS MOS Gateway 3, installation required installation and support of Microsoft Java VM for license management. Microsoft Java is no longer supported by Microsoft. iNEWS MOS Gateway 3.1.0 now uses Avid’s License Control application to manage licensing. If MOS Gateway 3.0.0 or 3.0.1 is installed, the 3.0.2 installer should be used to upgrade the previous install. The 3.0.0 and 3.0.1 uninstallers should not be used. Stories • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, some normal text would be replaced by presenter text as part of roStorySend. This is fixed. • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, tabs in the story body could be mishandled when NSMLX was not enabled. This is fixed. Replication • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, MOS replication would only replicate tags that were present in a pre-defined list of tags. This is fixed. MOS replication can now replicate all tags contained in the incoming message. An asterisk XPath statement can be used to replicate tags that contain multiple levels of children, like mosExternalMetadata or objPaths. This statement can only be used in the attachment sections of the story, not in the story body. Any XPath statement that produces an XML element will result in story save failures if used in the story body. For example: \"<mosExternalMetadata>%/mos/mosObj/MosExternalMetadata/*%</mosExternalMetadata>\" This example will replicate the complete contents of mosExternalMetadata. Only use this statement in the attachments. MOS Router Service • In previous versions of MOS Gateway 3.0, empty MOS messages sent from devices could cause MOS Router Service to terminate unexpectedly. This is fixed. • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, MOS Router Service could exit or fail to start if one of the configured devices was unreachable. This is fixed. MOS Router Service will now start correctly and report that the device is unreachable. Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 21 Hardware and Software Changes for Version 3.0.1 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 3.0.1. MOS Router Service • In previous versions of MOS Gateway, messages over 16KB would result in a MOS Router Service crash. This is fixed. Message size is now limited to 32764 bytes when used with iNEWS version 2.8.8 and earlier. Message size in iNEWS v3.0 and later is limited to 65,535 bytes. Hardware and Software Changes for Version 3.0.0 The following changes were made to iNEWS MOS Gateway version 3.0.0. roItemStat • MOS Gateway now supports feeding item channels back to iNEWS. Anytime an <itemChannel> tag is included in a roItemStat message, the text inside that element will be passed on to iNEWS as the new item channel. <mos> <mosID>MOS</mosID> <ncsID>NRCS</ncsID> <roItemStat> <roID>NRCS/SHOW.6PM.RUNDOWN</roID> <storyID>64261505</storyID> <itemID>MOS-Active</itemID> <objID>12345</objID> <status>READY</status> <time>2009-11-16T16:55:08</time> <itemChannel>A</itemChannel> </roItemStat> </mos> mosItemReplace • MOS Gateway now supports the mosItemReplace message, which allows a MOS server to update items in the NRCS database. This feature is activated by inserting \"YES\" into the AllowMosItemReplace line in the MOS configuration file (mosconfig.xml). MOS Gateway 3.0.0 will continue to work with earlier versions of iNEWS, but iNEWS Server 3.0.0 or later is required for mosItemReplace functionality. The message, which is delivered to iNEWS through a loaded monitor server, will update MOS items in the loaded rundown's story form and story body. The mosItemReplace command is defined in the MOS Protocol. Version 4.3.1 ReadMe 22 Known Limitations This section provides information on known limitations that were not addressed in this release. Any available workaround procedures are also documented, when possible. Note: For limitations related to compatibility of this release with previous versions/other products, see the section of this document entitled, “Compatibility Issues”. iNEWS iNEWS does not get \"Download Complete\" message from MOS Gateway This is caused by the MOS device not including a roID with its roAck to the Avid MOS Gateway after a show has been loaded. If the roID is not included in the message, the MOS Gateway does not know where to send the \"Download Complete\" message. iNEWS installer overwrites inewscom.dll registration used by MOS Gateway The registration of the inewscom.dll installed with MOS Gateway 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 will be overwritten by the iNEWS client install program. When this occurs, an incorrect version of the inewscom.dll is used by MOS Gateway. This can cause parts of the MOS Gateway functionality to fail, specifically roStorySend. Workaround: Do not install iNEWS client software on the MOS Gateway computer. Or install MOS Gateway after the iNEWS client software. MOS Gateway Unused MOS devices will generate reqMachineInfo errors in the log file If a MOS device is specified in the mosconfig.xml file and it is not present on the network, there will be errors indicating that the device is not reachable during start up of the MOS Gateway. This is normal behavior. Workaround: Remove any unused MOS device configurations from the mosconfig.xml file. MOS devices on the network but not specified in the mosconfig.xml file generates errors in the log file If a MOS device is present on the network and is configured to communicate with the MOS Gateway computer it will cause error messages to be logged in the MOS Gateway logging if it is not also specified in the mosconfig.xml file. This is normal behavior. Workaround: Remove from the network or reconfigure any unused MOS devices that are configured to talk to the MOS Gateway but are not going to be used. Additional download time overhead when using handlesRoStorySend option Because of the amount of data being processed and sent with this option enabled, the amount of time to load MOS devices will be significant. Workaround: Unless required by the MOS device, Avid recommend that this option be set to NO. Upgrades require uninstall first MOS Gateway does not support upgrades over existing installations. All upgrades of MOS Gateway require that previous versions of the software be uninstalled first.
