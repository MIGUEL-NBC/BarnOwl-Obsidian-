This evening is part 2 of the upgrade from last week. Once the upgrade is applied to both routers, we will resolve the bugs mentioned above. Below are all the items included on the patch: 1) To resolve an issue with routing where thereâ€™s a couple of seconds delay in routing cloud sources (via NAT) routes to Dests. 1) Add NATX driver to PROD and ACQ SDVN. 3) Resolved an issue where config-service restart results in federation-service disconnect hence requiring federation-restart. Post this update, no federation restart will be need when a config service update is done. 4) Add a flag to magnum to prevent audio devices (AGHUBs) resulting in sync errors on router-service restart 5) Add improvements so ports app page does not take a long time to load Here is the updated timeline: Saturday 9/18 through 9/19 from 10PM to 1AM - 10:20PM to 11:30PM- Upgrade on PROD, with no new Federated sources to be routable - 11:30PM to 1PM- Testing and faxes with CRs and Production Areas Reminder that during the 10:20PM to 11:30PM window, routing will be paused on the PROD-EXE. We will be implementing several backups and routing procedures that will allow us to get proper sources to the CRs and Ingest incase of breaking news or if our window goes longer. The Router Team and Evertz will be onsite and we will all be on the bridge while this work occurs. Please let me know if anyone has questions. Will make sure to update everyone along the way.
