{"path":"MediaCentral Command_DS_A4.pdf","text":"MEDIACENTRAL | COMMAND FOR MORE INFORMATION, VISIT avid.com/mediacentral Consolidate, control, and manage news playout with ease and produce reliable, accurate newscasts every time. MediaCentral ® | Command tightly syncs with MediaCentral | Newsroom Management, iNEWS ®, ENPS, and any MOS- supported interactive news management system, giving you precision control over a wide range of Avid and third-party video and graphics devices. Speed your time to air while minimizing mistakes with a powerful option for MediaCentral that provides stress relief in any newsroom. BOOST EFFICIENCY AND ACCURACY With its tight newsroom synchronization, MediaCentral | Command delivers unmatched efficiency and value to news directors and producers. It reliably manages playout by interoperating with newscast rundowns or standalone local playlists, taking the guesswork out of asset availability while enabling you to adapt quickly to late-breaking news. TAKE SIMPLE CONTROL With support for touchscreen monitors, the intuitive interface provides easy-to-use visual tools and controls that minimize ramp- up time and playout errors. Scrub, trim, and edit video. View, customize, and interact with thumbnails, clocks, and transport controls on any supported device. You can even trigger playout using a keyboard, X-keys device, GPI, touchscreen, or tablet. DO MORE WITH FEWER RESOURCES MediaCentral | Command sharpens your competitive edge by enabling higher-quality news delivery while reducing operating costs. It provides powerful inventory management, enabling you to browse, search, and rename assets on any device from any workstation. Plus, it supports more flexible workflow configurations with an open platform that works with FastServe®, AirSpeed®, Maestro ™, and third-party video and graphics devices. HAVE PEACE OF MIND With redundancy and mirrored or hot-swap channel playout, MediaCentral | Command can be configured to eliminate a single point of failure. If any Command component becomes unavailable during a transmission, a backup system can take over automatically without the need for manual intervention. Playout devices will still receive instructions from MediaCentral | Command if network connection with the newsroom computer system is lost, or if a change takes place before the rundown can be updated. GET EASY OPERATION IN A HYBRID CLOUD ENVIRONMENT MediaCentral | Command supports cloud-enabled workflows, enabling you to connect your on-premises Command system to a Microsoft Azure-deployed Avid Newsroom Cloud system in a hybrid environment, providing greater efficiency and flexibility.
