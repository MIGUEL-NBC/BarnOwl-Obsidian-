CA-54CFC BoardThe CA-54CFC board has the following functions.· Generate clock and timing signals synchronized with the reference signal and send them to the other boards.· Control LAN (connector “CTRL”)/Data LAN (connector “DATA”) data communication.· RS-422 data communication (connectors “REMOTE1 to 4”)· GPI input/output· Application software control and data management· Total system controlThe CA-54CFC board consists of the following boards.· CA-54CFC board itself· SG-272 board· DIF-130 board· SIO-25EF board· Main CPU module (CPU-DR or CPU-DT)· CPU-DK module for Control LAN (COM CPU-1)· CPU-DK module for Data LAN (COM CPU-2)The CA-54CFC board has three CPU modules: a main CPU module (CPU-DR or CPU-DT)for total control of the system and for GPI input/output, and two CPU-DK modules for data communication with the Control LAN (connector “CTRL”) and Data LAN (connector “DATA”).Each CPU-DK module is equipped with two RS-422 communication ports.The total system control is performed through the local CPUs and the Dual Port RAMs on the DVP-30A and VIF-32 boards.The CA-54CFC board itself executes the functions of the above-described child boards and modules, and outputs various kinds of information (such as FAN ERR signal, power information, reference signal information, and communication-related information) to the other boards for indicator display or as output data. The CA-54CFC board also supports Ethernet and RS-422 data communications.The DIP switches S102 and S103 on this board are used for setting ID (IP address, etc.) and other items. Power voltages 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V are supplied to each block.The SG-272 board mounted on the CA-54CFC board mainly generates horizontal sync pulse HD and vertical sync pulse VD, field information FLOE, register load pulse CKX, clock signal HFCK, and analog reference signals that are synchronized with the external reference signals. The main processor (IC113) that controls the functions of this board is automatically programmed by the PROM (IC302) when the power is turned on. The processor is controlled by the main CPU that rewrites its register through the local bus to change the reference signal phase and the output signal phase. The SG-272 board supports both the HD (1080i) and SD (525/625) signal formats.The reference signal status can be monitored with the LEDs (D100, 101, 200) on this board and with the LEDs (D601, 602) on the CA-54CFC board. This board also generates power voltages 5 V, 3.3 V, and 1.8 V from the 12 V supplied by the CA-54CFC board.The DIF-130 board mounted on the CA-54CFC board has functions to interface with and to control the compact flash card on this board. The flash card contains the MVE system program and the configuration data of the FPGAs mounted on each board. The DIF-130 board is controlled by the CPU-DK module (COM CPU 2) on the CA-54CFC board through the PCI bus. The controller (IC1) on this board takes charge of the interface and control between the PCI bus and the flash card. This board is equipped with sockets A and B for compact flash cards. The compact flash card that stores data required to start up the MVE system is always inserted into the socket A. The socket B is reserved for data copying or other purposes. The 3.3 V power is supplied from the CA-54CFC board.The SIO-25EF board mounted on the CA-54CFC board performs RS-422 data communication using the 4-channel SIO controller (IC102, 111, 118, 126). The SIO controller sends/receives data to/from the main CPU through the Dual Port RAM (IC101, 110, 117, 125) for parallel-to-serial and serial-to-parallel data conversions.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
