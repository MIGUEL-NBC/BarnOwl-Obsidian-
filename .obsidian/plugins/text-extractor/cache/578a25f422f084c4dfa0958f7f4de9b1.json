Control System similar to XPT-31 board (Cross-point IC is controlled.)  Local buss control board Controls by the CPU on the XPT-31 board. MVS-8000X XPT-32 Board 4 5/1/2012 1. Overall  XPT-32 board is an option board for MVS-8000X. The 80 x 80 channels XPT IC and the DME IF FPGA is used in DME Interface Board Set （MKS-8170X）.  DME I/F and extended serial cross point functions The function equivalent to the DIF-179 board of MVS-8000G and the ME4 KEY input selector is used.  XPT-32 is a local buss control board. It is controlled by the CPU on the XPT-31 board.  Common CPLD and FPGA are adopted for MVS-8000 Ｘ Xilinx XC3S200AN, XC5VLX50T  XPT-32 board is used in the dedicated slot of MVS- 8000Ｘ. It is installed in the SLOT3 of MVS-8000X. MVS-8000X XPT-32 Board 5 5/1/2012 2-1. POWER Block 2-2. XPT Block 2-3. CONTROL Block 2-4. FPGA Block 2.
