The MPU-302B board is connected to the DIO-78 board via the PCI bus, and the DVO signal output from the MPU-302B board is used to display the graphics on the Menu Panel (MKS-8010). The power supply voltage +5 V and the ATX power supply voltages ATX 5 V and ATX 3.3 V are supplied from the CA-57 board. The internal LAN is the interface to communicate with the CA-57 board in the unit (MKS-8010A), and not be input from or output to the outside of the unit. The HDD on the board stores the data such as the frame memory contents and various setup data. [CA-57 board] The CA-57 board plays the central role that controls the control panel and synchronizes the whole system. The CPU-DR module board is mounted on the CA-57 board. The CPU-DR module board is the center of all operations, and establishes communication with the devices connected to the CTRL LAN, PERIPH LAN, SBUS, and EDITOR PORT, establishes communication with the MPU-302B board via the Internal LAN, and controls the devices on the control panel by synchronizing the REF VIDEO signal that is input from outside. The built-in CPU of the FPGA (IC1000) mounted on the board realizes CTRL LAN and PERIPH LAN via Ethernet. FPGA (IC1800) establishes communication with the devices connected to the REMOTE terminal and the EDITOR PANEL terminal respectively. The three PLDs (IC701, IC1603, IC2501) control the devices on the control panel and the FP-141 board. The DC-DC converter on the CA-57 board generates +5 V, +3.3 V and +1.5 V to use in the CA-57 board, +5 V to supply to the MPU-302B board, and 5 V_ATX and 3.3 V_ATX of the ATX standard. 4 1.
