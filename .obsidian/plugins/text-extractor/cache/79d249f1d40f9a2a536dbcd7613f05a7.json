A Step by Step Guide STEP 1 Begin by having the necessary tools & a clean workspace. Pictured above are: Belden 1694A Violet Cable , BNC Crimper, Coaxial Stripping Tool STEP 2 Have the correct connector. Pictured above: Kings brand BNC pack size 10-9 used for 1694. Size 11-9 is used for 1855. Step 2 (Cont’d) Pack Includes: conductor pin, connector barrel, BNC connector. Step 3 For the stripping process only the specific stripper and the cable are needed. Step 4 Line cable up with edge of coax stripper & place squarely in the middle of stripper rollers. Adjust thumb lever forward until blade scores outer jacket. Step 5 Spin stripper forward. One or two turns should make initial cut. Step 6 Adjust thumb lever forward again until it stops. Spin stripper forward once or twice more. Step 7 Evaluate Strip. It should look like this. Step 8 Remove outer jacket from the strip closest to the top of the cable. Step 9 Remove di-electric. This exposes the copper conductor that the pin will eventually be crimped onto. Step 10 Place connector barrel onto cable at this point. This will help prevent forcing the barrel over the exposed metal braid later. Step 11 Remove outer jacket of middle strip. This exposes the di-electric. If there is foil wrapped around di- electric remove foil. Step 12 Remove outer jacket of last strip. This should expose the metal braid. Check to see if braid is evenly cut. Step 13 If braid is uneven then cut just enough to make it even using flush cutters. Step 14 Take conductor pin and place on copper conductor. Pin should sit flush on di-electric. Step 14 (Cont’d) Notice the small hole in the side of the pin. You should see the copper conductor inside the pin. If you are unable too then conductor is to short. You will have to repeat the entire process from the beginning if that is the case. Step 15 Crimp conductor pin using the proper gauge on the die. Step 16 Check the crimp by gently pulling on the pin to make sure it is securely crimped onto conductor. Step 17 Take connector and place onto cable over the di- electric and under the metal braid. Step 18 A handy trick is to gently move the di-electric back & forth to help open up the metal braid. Make sure connector seated all the way under the braid. Step 19 Slide connector barrel up over the braid & flush with the base of the connector. Step 20 Before crimping the barrel be sure and double check your work. You can tell if the connector is seated correctly if it looks like the picture. You should also be able to touch the pin. Step 21 Place barrel evenly in crimp die. 1694 & 1695 cable should be crimped in .278 gauge, 1855 should be crimped in .178 gauge. Step 22 Firmly crimp the barrel until the crimper releases on its own. Step 23 A proper center crimp should look like this with both ends of the barrel slightly flared out. Be sure and gently pull on connector to verify the crimp. Step 24 Double check your work by making sure there is no braid protruding in between the barrel and connector. Step 25 Finally, TEST to verify success!","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
