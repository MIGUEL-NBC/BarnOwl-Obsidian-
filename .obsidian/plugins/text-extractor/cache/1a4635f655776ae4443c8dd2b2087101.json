VIF-28 Board The VIF-28 board is a board to input/output the HD/SD multi-video format for the MVE-9000. This board consists of the control block, signal processing block, and serial digital input/output block. In the control block, the sub CPU receives the commands from the main CPU (on the CA- 54CFA board) through the dual port RAM (IC3401), and controls the signal processing block through the BOOT_PLD (IC3301). The signal processing block is controlled through the FPGA_IF (IC3601). The sub CPU starts up by the 1st boot of its flash memory, then has the applications started up by the 2nd boot of the booting flash memory (IC3501) on the VIF-28 board. The BOOT_ PLD (IC3301) performs configuration of the signal processing block (FPGA: IC1 to 3) which is under the control of the sub CPU. For the configuration, the address decode to the peripheral devices of the sub CPU and the data stored in the configuration flash memory (IC3502, 3503) are used. Configuration data and the applications stored in the flash memory are rewritten on every startup when the corresponding data in the compact flash card of the main CPU has been updated. The signal processing block consists of the five FPGAs: Input XPTs (IN_FPGA (V), IN_FPGA (K), and IN_FPGA (E)) and Mixers (VMIXA and VMIXB). Each FPGA has the following main functions. (1) IN_FPGA(V) (IC1) · 4CH Video Input/Reentry Crosspoint · Input Rough TBC (2) IN_FPGA(K) (IC2) · 4CH Key Input/Reentry Crosspoint · Input Rough TBC (3) IN_FPGA(E) (IC3) · 4CH External Video Input Crosspoint · Input Rough TBC (4) VMIX_A (IC4), VMIX_B (IC5) · Combine · Recursive Effect · Background Mix · Shadow Mix · Mask Process · Graphics Insertion · DME Monitor Select · Output Proc. The signal flows are as follows: The input signals for each four channels of Video/Key/External video are sent from the CN- 2355A/2355B/2355C, or CN-2357A/2357B, and are decoded in the S/P (Deserializer). The decoded Video/Key/External video signals are input into the IN_FPGAs (V/K/E) respectively, are synchronized with the internal clocks, and are then output to the C/L TRANS (CH-Link Transmitter). The Video/Key/External video signals of each channel are sent to each DVP-24A board of the corresponding channel through the MB-1000 board. The signals returned from each DVP-24A board are decoded in the C/L REC (CH-Link Receiver), and the Video/Key/External video/Z/PZ/Graphic signals for CH1 and CH2 are input in the VMIX_A (IC4) and those signals for CH3 and CH4 are input in the VMIX_B (IC5). The VMIX_A and VMIX_B are connected through the bi-directional data bus to mix the signals of CH1 and CH2, and CH3 and CH4. Also, the VMIX_A and VMIX_B have one SRAM (IC4901, 4902) and four SDRAMs (IC5001, 5002, 5101, 5102, 5201, 5301, 5202, and 5302) each, which are used for the effect processing. The Z/PZ signal is used for the combine processing in the VMIXs, where the graphic signal generated on each DVP-24A is also mixed with the video signal. The Video/Key/Monitor signals of CH1 and CH2, and those signals of CH3 and CH4 are respectively output from the VMIX_A and VMIX_B to the P/S (Serializer) through the output processing of each FPGA. These signals are converted into the SDI signals, and are output to the CN-2355A/2355B/2355C or CN-2357A/2357B.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
