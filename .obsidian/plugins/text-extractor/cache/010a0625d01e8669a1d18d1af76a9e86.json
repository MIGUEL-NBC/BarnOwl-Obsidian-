USP3 User Manual Page 15 of 73 GPO Actions Use this page to configure the operation of the local GPOs. If the GPOs are not used, this page may be left blank. USP3 User Manual Page 16 of 73 GPO OPERATING MODE Each GPO can be configured by the user to operate according to one of the following operating modes. Only one operating mode can be assigned to a GPO at any time. The assignment of a new operating mode automatically overrides the previous operating mode assignment. All GPO configurations are done from the USP’s GPO page or the USP’s Event Action Table. A) MOMENTARY OPERATION When the controlling switch is pressed, the GPO will immediately turn on and start its ON Time timer. When the user configured time period has elapsed, the GPO will automatically turn OFF regardless of the state of the controlling switch. If the controlling switch is held pressed after the elapsed time or quickly released before the elapse time has expired, the GPO will only turn OFF when the user configured ON Time has elapsed. The controlling switch must be released and then re-pressed before the GPO will turn ON again. B) FOLLOW/ LATCH OPERATION When the controlling switch is pressed, the GPO will immediately turn ON. When the controlling switch is released, the GPO will immediately turn OFF. If the controlling switch is held pressed, the GPO will stay ON while the switch is being held. This operation is configured via the USP’s Event Actions table. C) TOGGLE OPERATION When the controlling switch is pressed, the GPO will immediately change state. If the GPO was ON, it will turn OFF. If the GPO was OFF, it will turn ON. The GPO will not change state when the controlling switch is released. When the switch is released, the GPO will remain in its last state. This operation is configured via the USP’s Event Actions table. D) FLIP FLOP MODE OF OPERATION One switch controls two GPOs. When the switch is pressed and the current status is ON, then the 2nd GPO will be turned ON and the 1st GPO will be turned OFF. When the switch is pressed and the current status is OFF, then the 1st GPO will be turned ON and the 2nd GPO will be turned OFF. The GPOs can be configured as LATCH or MOMENTARY. The FLIP FLOP operation will be configured on a GPO by GPO basis in the Event Action Table. The FLIP FLOP operation is defined for GPOs located in the same unit, however it can be used for GPOs across multiple USP units. This operation is configured via the USP’s Event Actions table (See page 12). USP3 User Manual Page 17 of 73 E) GROUP (RADIO GROUP) OPERATION The GPO Group operates like a radio group of interlocked switches. Pressing one switch causes the other switches to automatically release. Only one switch will remain pressed at any time. A GPO can belong to one and only one GPO Group. More than one GPO Group can exist with each group made up of other GPOs. When a GPO is assigned to a new GPO Group, it is automatically removed from its previous group. Only one member of a GPO Group can be ON at any time. When a GPO member is turned ON, all of the other members are immediately turned off. The GPO will stay on until another member of the group is turned on. With the exception of powering on the USP, at least one GPO from the GPO group will be turned on. F) GPO CONTROL BY SWITCH ON A REMOTE USP The GPO can be controlled by a switch on a remote Universal Switch Panel in addition to being controlled by a switch on the same panel. The GPO will operate according to its user configured Operating Mode whenever the local or remote switch is pressed and released. G) GPO CONTROL BY GTP-32 OR DC20 EVENT The GPO can be controlled by a GTP-32 or DC20 event― GPI or Combinatorial. It will operate according to its user configured Operating Mode as if a local switch had been pressed or released. H) GPO CONTROL BY ETHERNET EVENT The GPO can be controlled by an incoming Ethernet command string/event. It will operate according to its user configured Operating Mode as if a local switch had been pressed or released. PARAMETER DESCRIPTION GPO Label: Enter any 15 characters or symbols.

Output actions will not fire unless they’re mapped to a source event within the Event Action Table. On an Event Action Table line, select an EVENT IN (left side of the table) then select an ACTION (right side of the table). Some events only support ON ACTIONS, so the OFF ACTION entries will be grayed out. One EVENT IN can trigger more than one ACTION. Select the same EVENT IN on multiple lines and then select an ON or OFF ACTION on each line. Only EVENTs and ACTIONs associated with the Remote Device’s Device Type or Connection Type will be displayed in the drop down menus. If the desired event or action is not displayed, then go to the Remote Device Assignment web page and change the Device Type or Connection Type for the Remote Device. There are 16 Sequence Timers. Use each Sequence Timer event number in multiple lines as the Event Type to create a sequence of actions. The first Sequence entry from the top of the table will be the first sequence action. The next Sequence entry from the top of the table will be the next sequence action. The Event column time is the delay before that line’s action will execute. Use Sequence Start action to start a sequence. Use Sequence Stop/ Reset to stop a sequence. The Sequence will always start at its first line. An “Override Local Action” link lets users execute the ON or OFF Actions of a given Event Action Table line without triggering the source event.

TALLY OPERATING MODE Key Tally is the change of state of an LCD backlight or text on the face of a front panel switch. Tallies can be driven by a source event or can follow an output action. Tallies can also be driven by remote events and actions from GTP-32’s, USP3’s and AIB’s. The LCD backlight colors available are: Red, Flashing Red, Blinking Red / Red-Dim, Flashing Red-Dim, Blinking Red-Dim Green, Flashing Green, Blinking Green / Green-Dim, Flashing Green-Dim, Blinking Green- Dim Aqua, Flashing Aqua, Blinking Aqua / Aqua-Dim, Flashing Aqua-Dim, Blinking Aqua-Dim Amber, Flashing Amber, Blinking Amber / Amber-Dim, Flashing Amber-Dim, Blinking Amber-Dim Blue, Flashing Blue, Blinking Blue / Blue-Dim, Flashing Blue-Dim, Blinking Blue-Dim Purple, Flashing Purple, Blinking Purple / Purple-Dim, Flashing Purple-Dim, Blinking Purple-Dim USP3 User Manual Page 52 of 73 There are two tally configurations, one configuration for an ON tally and another configuration for an OFF tally. All tally configurations are done from the USP’s Tally Assignment web page. FOLLOW OPERATION The tally follows the state of the GPI, GPO, KEY, MEM, SEQ, or ENABLE KEY. When a tally is configured as “Follow GPI”, the tally will follow the state of an external device, like a downstream keyer, through an external GPI. Only one GPI can be assigned to control a switch’s tally. When a new GPI is assigned to control a tally, the previous assignment is deleted. One GPI can be assigned to control more than one tally. The tally will turn ON when the controlling GPI is ON and turn OFF when the GPI is OFF. When a tally is configured as “Follow GPO”, the tally will follow the state of its local GPO. Only one GPO can be assigned to control a switch’s tally. When a new GPO is assigned to control a tally, the previous assignment is deleted. One GPO can be assigned to control more than one tally. The tally will turn ON when the local GPO is ON and turn OFF when the GPI is OFF. The tally follows the state of the GPO regardless of the operating mode of the GPO. When a tally is configured as “Follow KEY”, the tally will follow the state of its currently assigned front panel Key. The tally will turn ON when the Key is pressed and turn OFF when the Key is released. When a tally is configured as “Follow ENABLE”, the tally will follow the state of its local Enable panel switch. The tally will turn ON when the Enable button is ON and turn OFF when the Enable button is OFF. When a tally is configured as “Follow MEM”, the tally will follow the state of a local MEM. The tally will turn ON when a MEM is ON and turn OFF when a MEM is OFF. When a tally is configured as “Follow SEQ”, the tally will follow the state of a local sequence. The tally will turn ON when a sequence is ON and turn OFF when the sequence is OFF REMOTE OPERATION A tally can be configured to be controlled by a GPI, GPO or MEM on a remote Universal Switch Panel or by a remote event on a GTP-32/DC20. Similar to the Follow Operation, the tally will turn ON when the remote event is ON and turn OFF when the remote event is OFF. USP3 User Manual Page 53 of 73 GTP/DC EXTENDED TALLY OPERATION A tally can be controlled by multiple Combinatorial Logic events on a remote GTP-32/DC20. Each tally can be controlled by up to 5 different events. Each tally event name starts with ET_, followed by a Name field and a Status field. The Name field identifies the remote event as a member of a group of tallies on the USP. When a remote event is received that begins with ET, it compares the contents of the Status field with the Status field of all configured ET events within the group, as distinguished by the Name field. If a match is found, the Tally shows the configured Text/Font/Color for that event. All other tallies for that group are turned off. If the Status field does not match any configured events, then the Tally reverts to Off Text/Font/Color, as configured within the Tally Assignment Page. GTP/DC USER REGISTER OPERATION A tally can be controlled by User register events on a remote GTP-32/DC20. Each tally can be controlled by up to 5 different User register event values.

Upon receipt of a Sequence Start action, the timer for the Sequence’s first entry in the Event Action Table will start. Upon receipt of a Sequence Stop action, the sequence will immediately stop. The sequence entry in progress will halt without executing. The next Start action will cause the sequence to start at its first entry in the Event Action Table. When the last Sequence action executes, the sequence will automatically turn off and stop executing. If the last Sequence action is Sequence Start, the sequence will loop until a Sequence Stop is received. Example #1 Wait for Sequence Start action and then play sequence until end and stop.

A source events (GPI or Keypress) ON action will FLIP FLOP the action of two GPO’s. The selected MEM that is being toggled will need to be setup in following manner to trigger the FLIP FLOP action. ON ACTION: TURN ON GPO_1, TURN OFF GPO_2 OFF ACTION: TURN OFF GPO_1, TURN ON GPO_2 Example #1 MEM FLIP FLOP GPO 1 and 2 USP3 User Manual Page 67 of 73 Examples: MEM Radio Group To setup a MEM based RADIO GROUP TALLY the use of MEMs is required. First a MEM/s will need to be assigned to a Radio Group (RG1 – RG6) A source events (GPI, Keypress or Serial Event) ON action will turn ON the MEM/s associated with the Radio Group. MEM ON must be selected as the ON action for the Radio Group functionality to work properly. Assign each MEM to a specific USP3 Key in the Tally Assignment page. When a Source Event triggers on the USP3, the MEM tied to this source event will turn ON. This MEM ON action will cause its Key tally to turn ON all other Key tallies in the same Radio Group will turn OFF. USP3 User Manual Page 68 of 73 Examples: GPO Momentary Radio Group To setup a GPO Momentary Radio Group the use of MEMs is required. First, in the GPO actions page set the operating mode of each GPO you will be using to “momentary” and set the desired momentary on-time. Next, in the MEM Configuration page assign a MEM to each GPO that you will be using for your Radio Group. Under the Radio Group Dropdown, assign all MEM’s to the same radio group (RG1 – RG5) A source event (GPI, Keypress or Serial Event) ON action will turn ON the MEM/s and GPO’s associated with the Radio Group. MEM ON must be selected as the ON action for the Radio Group functionality to work properly.
