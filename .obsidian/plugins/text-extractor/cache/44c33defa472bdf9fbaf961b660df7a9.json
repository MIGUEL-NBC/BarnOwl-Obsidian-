Ensure that it is held straight when inserting. 2. Apply sufficient pressure (approximately 600 g to 700 g) to ensure that the optical contact is a little de- pressed. 3. While pressing the optical connector cleaner against the tip of the optical contact, rotate the optical connec- tor cleaner by 4 to 5 turns clockwise. Holding the optical connector cleaner at around its support facili- tates to apply the pressure. [Connector] Clean the tip of the white optical contacts using the optical connector cleaner. 1-7. Cleaning of Connector/Cable (HDC1000R/1400R/1500R/1580R) The photo receptive condition of the optical connector can be checked at OPTICAL CONDITION of the DPR board of the camera control unit. When lit in green: Normal (_17 dBm or above) When lit in yellow: Normal (_17 to _20 dBm) When lit in red: Abnormal (Less than _20 dBm) When lit in red, be sure to clean the optical contact por- tions. When lit in yellow, cleaning is recommended. The attenuation of the photo-receptive level may cause transmission error between the camera and HDCU. In the case of attenuation, be sure to clean optical contact por- tions proceeding as follows. The optical contact portions exist in the optical connector on the camera or HDCU, and in the optical/electrical cables. 1-7-1.

Notes on Repair Parts 1. Safety Related Components Warning w Components marked ! are critical to safe operation. Therefore, specified parts should be used in the case of replacement. 2. Standardization of Parts Some repair parts supplied by Sony differ from those used for the unit. These are because of parts common- ality and improvement. Parts list has the present standardized repair parts. 3. Stock of Parts Parts marked with “o” at SP (Supply Code) column of the spare parts list may not be stocked. Therefore, the delivery date will be delayed. 4. Harness Harnesses with no part number are not registered as spare parts. 1-19. Lead-free Solder Boards requiring use of lead-free solder are printed with a lead free mark (LF) indicating the solder contains no lead. (Caution: Some printed circuit boards may not come printed with the lead free mark due to their particular size.) : LEAD FREE MARK m . Be sure to use the lead-free solder for the printed circuit board printed with the lead free mark. . The lead-free solder melts at a temperature about 40 dC higher than the ordinary solder, therefore, it is recom- mended to use the soldering iron having a temperature regulator. . The ordinary soldering iron can be used but the iron tip has to be applied to the solder joint for a slightly longer time. The printed pattern (copper foil) may peel away if the heated tip is applied for too long, so be careful. 2-2 HDC1000R/V1(E) 5.

Turn on the light source and warm up for about 30 minutes. 2. Place the illuminance meter on the chart surface. Adjust the position and angle of the light source so that the whole surface of the chart is evenly 2000 lx. n Light the chart from almost the same direction and height as the camera to shoot the chart. 3-1-4. Maintaining the Grayscale Chart For the adjustment, using an 89.9 %-reflective grayscale chart is preferable. If a reflective chart is not available, use a well-maintained pattern box and a transparent grayscale chart for adjustment. Before beginning adjustment, set the illumination of the light source (or the luminous intensity on the chart surface) properly proceeding as follows and set the color temperature to 3200 K exactly by adjust- ing light. Information on the reflective grayscale chart (16 : 9) Recommended chart The reflective grayscale chart (16 : 9) is commercially available. Recommended chart: Reflective grayscale chart Supplier: MURAKAMI COLOR RESEARCH LABORATORY Handling precautions . Do not touch the chart’s surface. . Do not subject the surface to dirt, scratches or prolonged exposure to sunlight. . Protect the chart from excessive moisture and harmful gas. . Avoid resting articles against the case. . When the chart is not used for a long period and is stored, open the case and dry the chart for about an hour once or twice a month. Replacement period when the chart is used as the reference The reflective grayscale chart should be replaced every two years if it used as the reference. Because the chart deteriorates with time and proper adjustment cannot be achieved. Replacement period varies according to storage conditions of the chart. Setting illumination (when the reflective chart is used) 3-3HDC1000R/V1(E) Chart Luminance meter 1 m Setting luminous intensity (when the transparent chart is used) Equipment: Luminance meter (Konica Minolta LS-110 or equivalent. Calibrated.) 1. Light the pattern box and warm up for about 30 minutes. 2. Place the pattern box where the chart is not exposed to light, such as a darkroom. (Or cover the pattern box with a cover whose inside is painted in black.) 3. Place the luminance meter facing straight to the chart at a distance of 1 m from it. 4. Adjust the luminance control of the pattern box so that the white portion in the center of the chart is 573 ± 6 cd/m 2. n This corresponds to the luminous intensity on the 89.9 %-reflective chart at 2000 lx. 3-4 HDC1000R/V1(E) How to change the setting values To enter or cancel the setting value of items, which can be changed by turning the MENU SELECT control (HDC1000R) or rotary encoder (HDC1400R/1450R/ 1500R/1550R/1580R), proceed as follows.

RPN Compensation m . The residual point noise (RPN) of the CCD is automati- cally compensated with the automatic compensation (APR) function usually during the automatic black balance adjustment (ABB). If the RPN still remains after the APR is executed, perform the manual RPN compen- sation adjustment. . If any RPN still remains after the RPN compensation adjustment, handle it according to the flowchart. 3-10-1. Automatic Compensation (APR) When an RPN is detected in the screen, perform the automatic black balance adjustment (ABB) and remove the RPN with the APR function. m . RPNs of only one channel (R, G, or B) can be detected and compensated with one-time APR. To scan these three channels, be sure to perform the ABB three times. . The log of the address data of RPNs that have been compensated is updated each time the APR is performed. RPNs that are not detected with the APR function five times in a row, they are excluded from the scope of compensation and their data is deleted. 3-10-2. Manual RPN Compensation Adjustment The manual RPN compensation adjustment uses the SERVICE menu. For how to display the SERVICE menu, refer to the Section 5-1. Open the MANUAL RPN[S03] page of the SERVICE menu. Preparations . Perform the automatic black balance adjustment. Adjustment Procedure n Points that are adjacent laterally and diagonally to already compensated RPNs cannot be compensated. 1. Select the channel (R, G, or B) that is to be compensat- ed. ITEM : RPN CH SELECT → R, G, B 2. Adjust the H and V values and set the cross cursor center at the target RPN. When the cursor is placed accurately at the RPN position, the RPN is compensated. n Some RPNs seem to have been compensated even if the cursor is placed off the RPNs by one line or one pixel. Before proceeding to step 3, shift the cursor by one line or one pixel and check that the compensation position is correct. ITEM : RPN CURSOR → ON ITEM : CURSOR H POS ITEM : CURSOR V POS [Reference][Reference][Reference][Reference][Reference] One turn of the rotary encoder is equivalent to one- pixel shift. On the other hand, the cursor moves by two clicks of the rotary encoder because the cursor has a size of two pixels. 3. Press the rotary encoder and record the RPN data (correction value). ITEM : RECORD RPN → EXEC 4. A message “RECORD DATA OK? YES → NO” appears. Check that the RPN has disappeared and then select YES with the rotary encoder. 5. Press the rotary encoder. A message “COMPLETE!” appears and the RPN compensation starts. n If a compensation pixel has been wrongly recorded, delete the RPN data. ITEM : DELETE RPN → EXEC 6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 to compensate other RPNs. If any RPN still remains after this manual adjustment, handle it according to the flowchart.

Procedures to be Taken When the RPN Compensation Fails When the RPN compensation is not successful even after the manual RPN compensation adjustment was made, the following causes are possible. . An adjacent wrong position was compensated. . The compensation failed due to the influence of other RPNs. . The RPN with a very large level has an extent over one pixel that was made in the signal generation process. Checking Correction Points 1. Open the MANUAL RPN[S03] page of the SERVICE menu. 2. Set RPN CURSOR to ON. 3. Check whether there are any compensated pixels close to the pixel to be compensated with the CURSOR JUMP function. [Reference][Reference][Reference][Reference][Reference] Correction points can be checked effectively by placing the cursor in advance close to the pixel to be compensated by using CURSOR H POS and CUR- SOR V POS. When the target pixel is above the cursor position, ITEM : CURSOR JUMP → PREV When the target pixel is under the cursor position, ITEM : CURSOR JUMP → NEXT 4. When the cursor stopped at a position near the target pixel (1) Delete the data because the data is recorded so as to compensate the pixel at the cursor position. ITEM : DELETE RPN → EXEC (2) A message “DELETE DATA OK? YES → NO” appears. Select YES with the rotary encoder and then press the rotary encoder. n Appearance of an RPN next to the pixel to be compensated means that adjacent RPNs exit. If an RPN appears in the diagonal direction, the RPN cannot be compensated. In this case, the CCD or the CCD block must be replaced. For more information, contact your local Sony Sales Office/ Service Center. (3) If nothing has changed, change the compensation position. Move the cursor horizontally or vertically to check whether the RPN can be compensated. (4) When the RPN has been successfully compensat- ed, record the data. ITEM : RECORD RPN → EXEC (5) A message “RECORD DATA OK? YES → NO” appears. Select YES with the rotary encoder and then press the rotary encoder. 3-40 HDC1000R/V1(E) (6) A message “COMPLETE!” appears and the data is recorded. n When two RPNs are vertically adjacent to each other, record the data at the position where one RPN can be compensated. Then shift the cursor vertically by ± 1 at the same horizontal address and check whether the other RPN can be compensated. When the other RPN has been successfully compensated, record the data of the RPN. When two RPNs are horizontally adjacent to each other, move the cursor to the position where the left RPN can be compensated. Next, set RPN WIDTH to 2 and record the data, and then check whether these RPNs can be successfully compen- sated. If the RPN compensation failed, delete the data. Increase RPN WIDTH to 3, 4, ..., and select a value that allows the best compensation. For an RPN that has a horizontal extent (smear), increase RPN WIDTH from 1 to 2, 3, 4, ..., and select a value that allows the best compensation. 3-10-4. Performing Automatic RPN Detection Effectively 1. Open the RPN MANAGE[S05] page of the SERVICE menu. 2. Only perform the APR of RPNs. RPNs of three channels are automatically detected at the same time through this operation. ITEM : AUTO CONCEAL → EXEC m . Set IRIS at the CLOSE position. . Set the BARS switch to OFF. . Set the SHUTTER switch to OFF. . If AUTO CONCEAL is executed with a wrong switch setting, delete all the recorded data. Make these settings and execute AUTO CONCEAL carefully so that the RPN compensated data is not deleted completely. ITEM : RPN ALL PRESET → EXEC 3-41HDC1000R/V1(E) 3-10-5. RPN Compensation Flowchart If any RPN still remains after the manual RPN compensation adjustment, handle the RPN according to the following flowchart. The RPN level decreased? Check the connectors for connection between TG-266 board and PA-355 board. Perform the RPN adjustment. (Refer to the Maintenance Manual Section 3-3-7.) The adjustment was successful? Press the SHUTTER switch on the front panel of camera, and set the shutter speed to 1/2000. NO YES Replace the flexible card wire between TG-266 board and PA-355 board. Perform the manual RPN compensation. The RPN was compensated? Perform the RPN adjustment. (Refer to the Maintenance Manual Section 3-3-7.) YES There is an RPN that was not compensated by the manual RPN compensation adjustment. RPN was removed? Compensation is successful. Automatic black balance adjustment (ABB) (Set the AUTO W/B BAL switch to the BLK side.) Perform the ABB three times in a row. YES NO NO A failure in the TG-266 board or PA-355 board Replace these boards one by one, find the defective board, and repair the board. When there is another RPN, perform the manual RPN compensation again. YES NO Compensation is successful. The RPN cannot be compensated because the RPN is adjacent to another RPN. Replace the CCD block. 3-42 HDC1000R/V1(E) 3. Then adjust the horizontal cursor position to align the vertical axis of the cross cursor with the vertical line. ITEM : CURSOR H POS n One turn of the rotary encoder is equivalent to one- pixel shift. On the other hand, the cursor moves by two clicks of the rotary encoder because the cursor has a size of two pixels. 4. Place the cursor at “RECORD V.LINE” and press the rotary encoder to display “RECORD DATA OK? YES → NO.” ITEM : RECORD V.LINE → EXEC 5. Choose “YES” and press the rotary encoder. A message “LEVEL SETTING” appears. Place the cursor at “V.LINE LEVEL” and make fine adjustment while paying attention to avoid overcompensation (black lines) and insufficient compensation (white lines).

Lens File Lens File stores the data to compensate the differences of the white shading, flare balance, white balance, which occur when the lens extender is set to ON. It also stores the minimum f-stop value and name of the lens. Lens File data of up to 16 files can be stored for a lens that is not compatible with serial communica- tion and Lens File data of up to 50 files can be stored for a lens compatible with serial communication. The adjustment data can be called by selecting the Lens File. The Lens File stores the differential data from the Reference File. n Prior to creating the Lens File, perform the necessary adjustments by using the lens normally used to create the Reference File. Adjusting the Lens File Data (Using a lens not compatible with serial communication) (1) Mount the lens. Select the file with the same name as the lens mounted from the setup menu. If no file with the same name as the lens exists, select “NO OFFSET”. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [No.] → (Select the No.) (2) Select the name of the lens, and minimum f-stop value. (3) Set the lens extender to OFF. (4) Shoot the white pattern, and adjust V modulation R/G/B/Master so that the video level is around 560 mV (80 %) with the lens iris set around F4 and the zoom control in the center of the ring. (5) Adjust the white balance and flare balance shooting the grayscale chart. (6) Zooming the lens, and adjust the center marker to a position at which the object does not deviate. *1 (7) Store the data in the lens file. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [STORE|FILE] (8) Set the lens extender to ON. (9) Shoot the white pattern, and adjust V modulation R/G/B/Master so that the video level is around 560 mV (80 %) with the lens iris set around F4 and the zoom control in the center of the ring. (10) Adjust the white balance and flare balance shooting the grayscale chart. (11) Zooming the lens, and adjust the center marker to a position at which the object does not deviate. *1 (12) Store the Lens File. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [STORE|FILE] *1 : The center marker position is stored in the Lens File immediately after the position is aligned and not when executing the Lens File store. HDC1000R/V1(E) 4-9 (For lens compatible with serial communication) (1) Check that the lens number is No. 17. (2) Also check that the name of the lens and minimum f-stop value. (3) Turn on the dynamic shading. *1 (4) Set the lens extender to OFF. (5) Adjust the white balance and flare balance shooting the grayscale chart. (6) Zooming the lens, and adjust the center marker to a position at which the subject does not move. *2 (7) Store the Lens File. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [STORE|FILE] (8) Set the lens extender to ON. (9) Adjust the white balance and flare balance shooting the grayscale chart. (10) Zooming the lens, and adjust the center marker to a position at which the subject does not move. *2 (11) Store the Lens File. [FILE] → [LENS|FILE] → [STORE|FILE] *1 : If using the lens compatible with serial communication with the dynamic shading turned on, you do not require the V modulation adjustment. Adjust the white shading or V modulation only when the deviation occurs. In this case, the data will not be stored in the Lens File. *2 : The center marker position is stored in the Lens File immediately after the position is aligned and not when executing the Lens File store.

HDC1000R/1400R/1450R/1500R/1550R/1580R 6-1-1. BI-233 board The BI-233 board supplies the DC bias required for CCD. A CCD output two-channel signal is sent through an amplifier to the PA-355 board. Moreover, the BI-233 board mounts a horizontal CCD clock driver and reset gate driver. 6-1-2. PA-355 Board After CDS (Correlative Double Sampling), the PA-355 board multiplexes the two-channel from CCD so as to produce one signal. The PA-355 board then corrects the black shading, increases the gain, and sends the resultant data to the DPR-265A board. 6-1-3. TG-266 Board The TG-266 board establishes synchronization using the PLL-H signal input from the DPR-265A and generates a CCD drive pulse or sample-and-hold pulse. It also generates an error correction pulse or black shading correction signal. The TG-266 board mounts a test signal generator circuit. The test signal generator circuit is used for adjustment and maintenance by switching to a CCD output signal. CCD block adjustment data and error correction data are memorized in each EEPROM on this board. 6-1-4. DR-633 Board The DR-633 board mounts a CCD drive vertical driver, shutter pulse driver, and VH driver. It also generates a Vsub voltage peculiar to CCD and supplies it to CCD. 6-1-5. AT-163A Board The AT-163A board consists of a system control microcomputer and its peripheral circuit. A main program is written in EEPROM on the AT-163A board. The control data of a camera is saved in FRAM. The AT-163A board also mounts a lens interface circuit and auto iris control circuit. 6-1-6. AU-298 Board The AU-298 board mounts an incom input amplifier (consisting of two circuits), microphone input amplifier (consisting of two circuits), incom receive output circuit (consisting of two circuits), PGM output circuit (consisting of two circuits), tracker input/output circuit (consisting of one circuit), and earphone output circuit. Section 6 Circuit Description 6-2 HDC1000R/V1(E) 6-1-7. DAP-33A Board The analog two-channel incom signal and analog two-channel microphone signal input from the AU-298 board are sent through the DAP-33A board to CCU. Digital signals are converted into an analog two- channel incom signal and analog two-channel program signal and output to the AU-298 board. 6-1-8. VDA-63A Board The digital signal from the DPR-265A board is converted into an analog signal using a D/A converter. Among the R/G/B/Y signals or RET signals (Y) of a camera, a sync signal is added to the selected signal. The added signal is output from a 75 Z driver to a viewfinder or camera’s TEST OUT connector. 6-1-9. DPR-265A Board The R/G/B signal that is input from the PA-355 board through the CN-3132, CN-2609G (HDC1000R only), and MB-1059GA/1060G boards is passed through a pre-filter and then converted from analog to digital. Camera process treatment and enhancement processing such as knee and gamma correction are performed by Vigent-LSI. Down-conversion into an SD signal and generation of a viewfinder signal are performed in Baryon-LSI. A digital output signal is sent to the SDI-84A board and then transmitted to CCU. 6-1-10. SDI-84A Board (HDC1000R/1400R/1500R/1580R only) A digital audio signal and command are multiplexed into the video signal in a main channel sent from the DPR-265A board. Moreover, the video signal in a main channel is converted from parallel to serial, converted from electric to optical, and sent to CCU as a serial optical signal. The serial optical return video signal sent from CCU is converted from optical to electric and converted from serial to parallel. Next, the digital audio signal, command, and prompter video signal multiplexed into the return video signal are separated, and the return video signal, digital audio signal, and command are sent to each board. 6-1-11. TR-136 Board (HDC1450R/1550R only) The audio digital signal, in a main channel, sent from the DPR board is converted from digital to analog and modulated to the RF signal suitable for triaxial cable transmission. The RET and audio RF signals sent from HDFX100 are demodulated and output to the DPR-265A board.
