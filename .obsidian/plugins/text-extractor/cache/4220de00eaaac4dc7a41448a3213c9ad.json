Thus a very small proportion of pixels may be “stuck,” either always off (black), always on (red, green, or blue), or flashing. In addition, over a long period of use, because of the physical characteristics of the liquid crystal display, such “stuck” pixels may appear spontaneously. These problems are not a malfunction. Cleaning the touch panel When cleaning the touch panel display, use a soft cloth and some ethanol to gently wipe only the area that is dirty. Using too much ethanol or broad wiping may result in smearing. You can also use a soft, dry cloth such as that used for cleaning glasses to gently wipe off the dirt. • Do not clean the touch panel with water or any chemical substances other than ethanol. • When wiping the touch panel, take proper care to prevent any liquid from entering between the touch panel and the body of the unit. • Using excessive force when wiping may result in scratches on the touch panel. Note on interference Do not place mobile phones or similar devices on the control panel. Doing so may result in malfunction of the unit. Notes Overview 7 Overview Features The MSU-1000 series and RCP-1000 series are remote control panels for configuring and controlling Sony’s studio and broadcast cameras. This section describes the features that are common between the MSU-1000 series and RCP-1000 series. Remote control panels The RCP-1000 series of remote control panels is designed mainly for operation. Use a remote control panel with a camera on a one-to-one basis. • The RCP-1530 incorporates an LCD display with a touch panel, and a variety of settings are available to make this remote control panel compare favorably with the MSU. It is multifunctional while at the same time having a slim body that is just 80 mm wide, which allows you to mount up to five units in a 19-inch EIA rack. The iris and master black adjustment block employs joystick type control. • The RCP-1500 incorporates an LCD display with direct operation switches and a touch panel, which makes it a remote control panel that offers both ease of operation and multifunctionality that compares favorably with the MSU. The iris and master black adjustment block employs joystick type control. Up to four units can be mounted in a 19-inch EIA rack. • The RCP-1501 incorporates an LCD display with direct operation switches and a touch panel, which makes it a remote control panel that offers both ease of operation and multifunctionality that compares favorably with the MSU. The iris and master black adjustment block employs dial (knob) type control. Up to four units can be mounted in a 19- inch EIA rack. Operability suitable for basic camera operations This remote control panel is provided with the control functions required to perform the basic operations of cameras to enable the simple and accurate operation of various functions. The operation buttons, adjustment knobs, and other controls are arranged on the panel according to function and frequency of use. Guard frames are provided around buttons that are vital to the operation and setup of cameras to prevent the buttons from being unintentionally operated. Illuminated buttons with high visibility flash and light to notify you of the operation status to enable operation even in dark locations. Likewise, an illuminated panel surface is employed to allow you to confirm function names even when the surroundings are dark. Building of a variety of control systems It is possible to connect by LAN cable in addition to connecting using CCA-5 cable. Therefore, when setting up a multi-camera control system, not only can a system be built using the CNU-700 as previously, but a system can also be built using a LAN. In a system that uses CNU-700s, two camera command network units (CNUs) can be used to control a camera system of up to 24 cameras. In a system that uses a LAN, a camera system of up to 96 cameras can be controlled. Support for operating multiple cameras Various operations are made possible by using multiple camera systems that support multiple cameras. The following functions are provided to control the connected cameras. • Panel active function This function always enables one control panel for one camera to prevent unintentional operation. Even with a control panel that does not have the panel active permission, a camera can be operated using the parallel function, with the exception of iris and master black operations. • RCP assignment function This function changes the combination of an RCP and camera system.1) • Master/subordinate function This function makes changes in conjunction with the color temperature of the specified camera system.1) 2) Customizable functions Various settings can be configured according to the operation configuration and the frequency with which functions are used. • Menus You can create a custom paint menu, and change the contents and order of a menu. • Function restriction You can restrict access to items of a certain level or above to restrict the operators that can configure settings. •Switches You can assign any function to a spare switch. • Adjustment knobs3) You can assign any function to a spare adjustment knob. • Operation and call sounds You can mute and adjust the volume of the operation and call sounds if necessary. • Exporting and importing of settings You can save the settings to a “Memory Stick Duo”, and then export them to another remote control panel. 1) If multiple CNUs exist in the system, this only works for cameras connected to the same CNU. 2) This does not work when connected to a network. 3) Customization of the adjustment knobs is only possible with the RCP-1500/1501. 8 Overview Examples of System Configurations Connection example for LEGACY mode • The maximum cable length for from a CCU (camera control unit) to an RCP is 200 m. • Up to six systems can be connected to a CNU-700 as standard. In such a case, connect one MSU and one VCS. Up to 12 systems can be connected if you install BKP-7930 in the CNU-700. In such a case, connect two MSUs and two VCSs. • Up to 24 systems can be connected if you connect a pair of CNU-700s. In such a case, you can connect four MSUs and four VCSs, but ALL, RCP assignment, and master/subordinate cannot be executed for cameras connected to a different CNU. Camera heads CCU VCS-700 CCU (1 to 6) VCS CNU-700 MSU-1000/1500 CCA-5 cable RCP (1 to 6) CCU/CNU REMOTE RCP-1500/1501/1530 MSU Overview 9 Connection example for MCS mode Regarding the power supply of a switching hub The power consumption of the PoE of this control panel is 7 W. Use a hub capable of supplying enough power for all connected RCPs. • In MCS mode, be sure to set one of the multiple MSUs as the master. Not to turn off the power or disconnect the cable of the master MSU during operation. • The maximum number of devices that can be directly connected to the network is 96 excluding the master MSU. This maximum number does not include any RCP connected by CCA cable to a CCU connected to the network or any CCU connected by CCA cable to a RCP connected to the network. A client MSU is counted as one unit. • A CNU and VCS cannot be connected to a system that will be used in MCS mode. Camera heads CCU MSU-1000/1500 RCP-1500 PoE compatible switching hub LAN straight cable (category 5 or above) RCP-1501 RCP-1530 10 Overview Supported devices This unit supports connection to the following devices. • BVP-E30 series • CCU-590/790 series • HDC1000(R)/1500(R)/3300(R) series • HDCU1000/1500/3300(R) series • HDC2000/2500 series • HDCU2000/2500 series • HSC-300/HSCU-300 series • HXC-100/HXCU-100 series • HXC-D70/HXCU-D70 series • HDC-P1 • HDFA-200 • F23/F35 • SRW-9000/SRW-9000PL • PDW-700/740/F800 • Proper functioning may not be possible depending on the firmware version. Be sure to update to the latest version before use. • The functions that are available on the control panel may be limited depending on the connected camera. Some controls may not function with certain cameras, but this is not a malfunction. Operating Cameras Camera control permissions (panel active, IRIS/MB active, and PARA) By combining an MSU and RCP, you can operate one camera device from multiple control panels, and multiple cameras from one MSU. This is called a “multi-camera system.” A multi- camera system can be implemented by introducing a CNU or by establishing a LAN connection in MCS mode. To prevent unintentional operation in a multi-camera system, permission is granted to operate the cameras for only either the connected MSU or RCP. There are three types of permission. • Panel active Even if multiple control panels are connected to one camera, only one control panel has the control permission. This panel is referred to as “active.” An inactive control panel can only be used to display the status. • PARA (parallel control) By enabling the PARA function on an inactive control panel, you can control cameras. The PARA function is enabled from an inactive control panel, but can be disabled from any control panel. • IRIS/MB active To prevent unintentional operation of IRIS and master black, you can choose the control panels on which to activate IRIS/MB. The PARA function does not operate. Operating an inactive control panel on which PARA is disabled will not change the state of the camera. White balance link (master/subordinate mode) The color temperature of light shining on the subject varies moment by moment when you shoot outdoors. When correcting for this, you can link the cameras within the system and then control them. When you do this, set the camera that is to be controlled directly to “Master,” and the cameras that are to be linked to “Subordinate.” When you change the white balance of the control panel to which the master camera is connected, the subordinate cameras are corrected by the same correction amount. However, adjusting a subordinate camera does not affect any of the other cameras. The white balance link function is only enabled when there is a connection to a CNU (LEGACY mode). The functions that are available on the control panel may be limited depending on the connected camera. Some controls may not function with certain cameras, but this is not a malfunction.
