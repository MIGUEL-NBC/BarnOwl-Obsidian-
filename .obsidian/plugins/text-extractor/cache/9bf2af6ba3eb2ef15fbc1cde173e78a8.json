OPERATION OVERVIEW The Universal Switch Panel (USP) is a panel of generic switches designed to emulate the operation of mechanical switches. The mechanical switch feel is provided by the USP’s front panel switch. The mechanical switch’s contact closure is provided by the USP’s general purpose outputs (GPO). The mechanical switch’s internal tally indicator is provided by the USP switch’s backlight. Unlike mechanical switches, the operating mode of the front panel switches, GPO contact closures, and tally can be easily configured by the user for their specific application. Additionally, ON text and OFF text can be displayed on the face of the USP switch. Each switch can be configured to operate standalone or as part of a radio group. Also, each GPO contact closure can be configured to operate as Momentary, Latching, or interlocked (commonly referred to as “radio group”). And, each tally can be configured to be Always ON, Always OFF, follow the state of the contact closure, or follow the state of an external device. Additionally, the ON and OFF tally for each tally can be individually configured to be Dark, Red, Green, or Amber, and Flash or not. Unlike a mechanical switch, a switch on the Universal Switch Panel can be configured to control a GPO on another USP, turn it ON and OFF. A. FRONT PANEL SWITCH Pressing a switch causes its associated GPO to turn ON or turn OFF. The switch contacts, represented by the GPO, operate according to the user configured GPO operating mode. The switch can control a GPO located on the same panel or it can control a GPO located on another, remote, USP. Each switch used on the USP front panel has an LCD display mounted on its face. The display is used to show an ON tally text label and an OFF tally text label. Each switch display can be configured by the user to show 1 row of 3 characters, 2 rows of 4 characters each, or 3 rows of 6 characters each. The display backlight functions as the tally, replacing an internal bulb or led. The user can individually configure each backlight to turn red, green, amber, or dark to show an ON or OFF tally. Additionally, the backlight can be configured to flash in its ON or OFF tally state. Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual 5 OF 41 B. REAR PANEL GPO Each GPO contact closure is a single pole, single throw relay. The GPO connector on the rear of the USP provides access to the relay contacts, Common and Normally Open (N.O.), providing isolation between outputs. A common bus (CB) is also available to tie one side of the relays to a common ground or voltage. The operating mode of each GPO can be individually configured to one of the following modes: 1. MOMENTARY MODE The GPO will turn on when its controlling switch is pressed and then automatically turn off after a preset time. The GPO will not change state when the switch is released. 2. LATCHING MODE The GPO will change state when the switch is pressed. If the GPO was OFF, it will turn ON. If it was ON, it will turn OFF. The GPO will not change state when the switch is released. 3. FOLLOW MODE The GPO will turn ON when the controlling switch is pressed and immediately turn OFF when the switch is released. 4. FLIP FLOP MODE The FLIP FLOP is a special case of a GPO Radio Group. One switch controls two GPOs. One GPO is ON while the other GPO is OFF. When the switch is pressed the GPOs will alternate states, the previously ON GPO will turn OFF and the previoulsy OFF GPO will turn ON. 5. GROUP MODE There are 8 GPO groups, RG1 through RG8. A GPO can be a member of only one group at a time. The group operates in a manner similar to interlocking mechanical switches― when one switch is pressed, all of the other switches are released. When any member of the group is turned ON, all of the other members are immediately and automatically turned OFF. Only one member of a group can be ON at any time. C. FRONT PANEL TALLY The tally is the LCD backlight on the face of the switch. For Tally ON and Tally OFF states, each tally can be individually configured to be dark, red, green, amber, flashing red, flashing green, or flashing amber. The tally can be configured to show the current state of the controlled GPO or show the current state of a General Purpose Input (GPI) on the rear of the USP. The GPI is used to monitor the status of an external device. There are 16 GPIs available on two rear panel connectors. The tally can be assigned to only one GPI at a time. When the GPI is ON, the tally will turn ON. When the GPI is OFF, the tally will turn OFF. 6 OF 41 Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual III. SWITCH OPERATING MODE Each switch can be assigned to control one or more GPOs through the USP’s SWITCH ASSIGNMENT web page. When the switch is pressed, each controlled GPO changes state according to its individual user configured operating mode. (See GPO OPERATING MODE section of this document). When the switch is released, only those GPOs configured for FOLLOW Operating Mode will change state. IV. GPO OPERATING MODE Each GPO can be configured by the user to operate according to one of the following operating modes. Only one operating mode can be assigned to a GPO at any time. The assignment of a new operating mode automatically overrides the previous operating mode assignment. All GPO configurations are done from the USP’s GPO page. A. MOMENTARY OPERATION When the controlling switch is pressed, the GPO will immediately turn on and start its ON Time timer. When the user configured time period has elapsed, the GPO will automatically turn OFF regardless of the state of the controlling switch. If the controlling switch is held pressed after the elapsed time or quickly released before the elapse time has expired, the GPO will only turn OFF when the user configured ON Time has elapsed. The controlling switch must be released and then re-pressed before the GPO will turn ON again. B. FOLLOW OPERATION When the controlling switch is pressed, the GPO will immediately turn ON. When the controlling switch is released, the GPO will immediately turn OFF. If the controlling switch is held pressed, the GPO will stay ON while the switch is being held. C. LATCH OPERATION When the controlling switch is pressed, the GPO will immediately change state. If the GPO was ON, it will turn OFF. If the GPO was OFF, it will turn ON. The GPO will not change state when the controlling switch is released. When the switch is released, the GPO will remain in its last state. D. FLIP FLOP MODE OF OPERATION The FLIP FLOP is a special case of a GPO Radio Group. One switch controls two GPOs. When the switch is pressed and the current status is ON, then the 2 nd GPO will be turned ON and the 1st GPO will be turned OFF. When the switch is pressed and the current status is OFF, then the 1 st GPO will be turned ON and the 2nd GPO will be turned OFF. The current status can be the state of the 1 st GPO (lowest number) or it can be the state of the primary GPI (lowest number). The GPOs can be configured as LATCH or MOMENTARY. The FLIP FLOP operation will be configured on a GPO by GPO basis in the GPO Assignment Table. The drop down selection of GPO operations will include 8 FLIP FLOP selections― FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF5, FF6, FF7, FF8 ― on a USP-16 and 4 FLIP FLOP selections on a USP-8. Only two GPOs can be assigned to a specific FLIP FLOP. The FLIP FLOP operation is defined for GPOs co-located in the same unit. It is NOT currently defined or supported for GPOs across multiple USP units. Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual 7 OF 41 E. GROUP (RADIO GROUP) OPERATION The GPO Group operates like a radio group of interlocked switches. Pressing one switch causes the other switches to automatically release. Only one switch will remain pressed at any time. A GPO can belong to one and only one GPO Group. More than one GPO Group can exist with each group made up of other GPOs. When a GPO is assigned to a new GPO Group, it is automatically removed from its previous group. Only one member of a GPO Group can be ON at any time. When a GPO member is turned ON, all of the other members are immediately turned off. The GPO will stay on until another member of the group is turned on. With the exception of powering on the USP, at least one GPO from the GPO group will be turned on. F. ALARM OPERATION The GPO can be used to indicate the presence of an alarm condition, either active or not cleared alarm. The GPO will turn ON when any alarm is active or has not been cleared. It will turn OFF only when all alarms have been cleared. G. GPO CONTROL BY SWITCH ON A REMOTE USP The GPO can be controlled by a switch on a remote Universal Switch Panel in addition to being controlled by a switch on the same panel. The GPO will operate according to its user configured Operating Mode whenever the local or remote switch is pressed and released. H. GPO CONTROL BY GTP-32 OR DC20 EVENT The GPO can be controlled by a GTP-32 or DC20 event― GPI or Combinatorial. It will operate according to its user configured Operating Mode as if a local switch had been pressed or released. V. TALLY OPERATING MODE The tally is the LCD backlight on the face of the front panel switch. It will be dark, red, green, amber, flashing red, flashing green, or flashing amber, as configured by the user on the USP’s Tally Configuration web page. There are two tally configurations, one configuration for an ON tally and another configuration for an OFF tally. All tally configurations are done from the USP’s Tally web page. A. FOLLOW GPO OPERATION The tally follows the state of the GPO. The tally is ON when the GPO is turned ON and OFF when the GPO is turned off. The tally follows the state of the GPO regardless of the operating mode of the GPO. B. EXTERNAL (GPI) OPERATION The tally can follow the state of an external device, like a downstream keyer, through an external GPI. The USP has 8 or 16 GPI Inputs, located on the rear of the unit. Each GPI is an opto-isolated input, providing electrical isolation between the external device and the USP. The external GPI can be assigned to control the tally on a switch. Only one GPI can be assigned to control a switch’s tally. When a new GPI is assigned to control a tally, the previous assignment is deleted. One GPI can be assigned to control more than one tally. The tally will turn ON when the controlling GPI is ON and turn OFF when the GPI is OFF. 8 OF 41 Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual C. REMOTE OPERATION A tally can be configured to be controlled by a GPO on a remote Universal Switch Panel or by a remote event on a GTP-32/DC20. Similar to the Follow GPO Operation, the tally will turn ON when the remote GPO is ON and turn OFF when the remote GPO is OFF. D. EXTENDED TALLY OPERATION A tally can be controlled by multiple Combinatorial Logic events on a remote GTP-32/DC20. Each tally can be controlled by up to 5 different events. Extended Tally operation requires the USP-ET software, and replaces Alarm Mode when installed. Each tally event name starts with ET_, followed by a Name field and a Status field. The Name field identifies the remote event as a member of a group of tallies on the USP. When a remote event is received that begins with ET, it compares the contents of the Status field with the Status field of all configured ET events within the group, as distinguished by the Name field. If a match is found, the Tally shows the configured Text/Font/Color for that event. All other tallies for that group are turned off. If the Status field does not match any configured events, then the Tally reverts to Off Text/Font/Color, as configured within the Tally Assignment Page. VI. ALARM MODE The Tally Alarm mode of operation allows multiple tally sources― Local GPIs, Remote USP GPIs, Remote USP GPOs, GTP-32 Events, and DC20 Events― to be combined into an Alarm Group to control a specific tally (LCD display). Eight Alarm Groups are supported. Each Alarm Group can contain any combination of tally sources. The tally sources within a group are prioritized by the user. When refreshed after a change, the Alarm Assignment Table will display the table in order of Alarm Group and by Priority within the Alarm Group. When a tally source turns ON, it is considered alarmed. If the tally source has the higher priority of alarmed sources within its group, its alarm indicator (ON tally configuration) will be reflected on the switch LCD display― ON text, ON font, ON color. The user must press the associated switch (part of LCD display) to clear the displayed alarm. If the tally source is still ON, the LCD display will continue to show the tally source’s alarm indicator. The LCD display will always show the alarm indicator of the higher priority alarmed tally source that is ON. Alarms from ON tally sources will be prioritized over alarms from tally sources that have turned OFF. If there are no alarms with ON tally sources, then the higher priority alarm of the alarms with tally sources that have turned OFF will be displayed on the LCD. When the alarm is cleared, by pressing the switch, the new higher priority alarmed tally source will be reflected on the LCD display. When there is no alarmed tally source in the Alarm Group, the LCD display will reflect the assigned OFF tally configuration. When the higher priority alarmed tally source is ON, the LCD display will flash. When the higher priority alarmed tally source is OFF, the LCD display will stop flashing and turn on solid. This behavior is the same for LATCH and TOGGLE style GPI tally sources. Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual 9 OF 41 The “Source” column in the TALLY ASSIGNMENT TABLE is used to select Normal or Alarm mode of tally operation, as well as the Alarm Group number (1-8) assigned to the tally. A switch configured for Alarm Tally may also be configured to control a local or remote GPO. Any GPO configured for Alarm mode will turn ON when any alarm is active and has not been cleared by pressing the appropriate switch. The GPO will turn OFF only when all alarms have been cleared. The GPO will not distinguish between alarm groups. More than one GPO can be configured for Alarm mode of operation. Alarm Tallies are not available on units containing the Extended Tally software. VII. EVENT NOTIFICATION MODE The Event Notification mode of operation allows local GPI and GPO events to be sent to remote USP and GTP-32 units. Remote USPs can use the event notification to turn on/off front panel tally indicators. Remote GTP-32s can use the event notification in the Event Monitor Table and in Combinatorial Event Definitions. 1. GETTING STARTED…… A.

GPI 1) USER DEFINED \"ON\" STATE. a) Opto ON When the unit is going to be used with the external source supplying power, the \"ON\" state should be defined as \"opto ON\". Since the opto circuit is normally off, it will be turned on by the application of the external signal. Connection of power = ON No connection of power = OFF b) Opto OFF When the unit is wired using the internal power supply (wet mode), the \"ON\" state should be defined as \"opto OFF. Since the internal power supply is supplying power to the opto circuit we are acctually turning it on, but since we want it to be off, we need to tell the GPI state to be off. When we short the GPI input to ground by the external signal, we will be turning it off, but then we invert the signal and make the GPI state be ON. So an external short to ground will cause the GPI state to turn ON. Connection to ground = ON No connection to ground = OFF 2) USER DEFINED \"ON\" MODE. a) Latched The user defined \"ON\" mode as LATCHED, means that the GPI state will follow the external signal. When the signal is 'on' the GPI state is on, when the signal is 'off' the GPI state is off. This, of course, is conditioned by the above \"user defined 'ON' state\". The GPI state follows the input signal Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual 37 OF 41 b) Toggle The user defined \"ON\" mode as TOGGLE, means that the GPI state will change from OFF to ON or from ON to OFF depending on the last condition of the GPI state. This, of course, is conditioned by the above \"user defined 'ON' state\". If the GPI state was 'off' and the input signal turns to 'on', the GPI state will change to 'on'. If the GPI state was 'on' and the input signal turns to 'on', the GPI state will change to 'off'. 3) DEBOUNCE TIME (ADJUSTABLE FROM 10MS TO 2000MS IN 10MS INCREMENTS). The \"debounce time\" setting causes the input signal to not affect the GPI state unless it is 'on' longer than the debounce time. If the input signal is not on for the duration of the debounce time the input signal is considered to be not valid. For short time settings, this acts as a spike filter, to not allow spurious signals to affect the GPI state. When the time setting is made long, this can be used to delay the input signal, as long as the input signal is longer than the debounce time setting. 38 OF 41 Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual B. GPO 1) USER DEFINED \"ON\" STATE. a) Relay CLOSED This setting will cause the relay to close the GPO connection when the switch is pressed. The relay will be open when the switch is not being pressed. b) Relay OPEN This setting will cause the relay to open (break) the GPO connection when the switch is pressed. The relay will be closed (on) when the switch is not being pressed. 2) OPERATING MODE a) Latch Setting the operating mode to LATCH will cause the GPO state to change to the opposite state each time that the switch is pressed. Regardless of when the switch is released, the GPO will not change state until the switch is pressed again. Press the switch, the GPO changes to ON, press switch again, the GPO changes to OFF, press switch again, the GPO changes to ON, ect.,etc. b) Momentary Setting the operating mode to MOMENTARY will cause the GPO state to turn on each time that the switch is pressed. The time that the GPO remains on depends on the 'MOMENTARY ON TIME', regardless of how long the switch is held down. Press switch - GPO goes on , GPO goes off after 'on time' expires Release switch - nothing happens c) Follow Setting the operating mode to FOLLOW will cause the GPO state to turn on when the switch is pressed and cause the GPO state to turn off when the switch is released. Press switch - GPO goes on Release switch - GPO goes off Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual 39 OF 41 d) Group A-H Setting the operating mode to GROUP 'x' will cause the 'y' GPO state to turn on when the 'Y' switch is pressed and cause all the other GPO states, that are assigned to the 'x' group, to turn off. Assign switches 1, 2, 3, 4 to group 'x'. Press switch 2 - GPO 1, 3, 4 stays off or goes off, GPO 2 goes on. Press switch 1 - GPO 2, 3, 4 stays off or goes off, GPO 1 goes on. Press switch 3 - GPO 1, 2, 4 stays off or goes off, GPO 3 goes on. Press switch 4 - GPO 1, 2, 3 stays off or goes off, GPO 4 goes on. 3) MOMENTARY ON TIME (ADJUSTABLE FROM 10MS TO 2000MS IN 10MS INCREMENTS) This setting sets the time that the GPO state will remain on after the the switch is pressed. This is only used for the MOMENTARY MODE. 40 OF 41 Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual NOTES: Universal Switch Panel (USP) User Manual 41 OF 41 DNF CONTROLS LIMITED WARRANTY DNF Controls warrants its product to be free from defects in material and workmanship for a period of one (1) year from the date of sale to the original purchaser from DNF Controls.
