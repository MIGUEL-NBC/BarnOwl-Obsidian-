IF-848 Board (MKS-8702) The IF-848 board contains the six channels of the RS-422A interface circuit that controls VTRs and other equipment. All of the six channels can be used as the Serial GPI Output as desired. The IF-848 board can be installed in any of the desired slot of slot 2 to slot 6 of the MKS-8700 main unit. The CPU-DK module (IF CPU board) that is installed in the CN610 interfaces with the main CPU of the CA-47 board installed in slot 1 via the 32-bit dual port RAM. The IF-848 board receives the control information from the main CPU of the CA-47 board and sends it to the SIO controlling the RS-422A via the 8-bit dual port RAM. The single SIO can control the two channels of the RS-422A. The control data establishes interface with the external equipment at CN401 to CN406 via the driver/receiver complying with the RS-422A standard and via CN2194 on the rear slot. The power supply voltages of +3.3 V and +5 V within the IF-848 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-949 board.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
