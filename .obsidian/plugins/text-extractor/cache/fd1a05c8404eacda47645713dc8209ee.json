If the switch is not operating, the temperature must be between –40 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit (–40 to 70 degrees Celsius). Humidity Requirements High humidity can cause moisture to enter the switch. Moisture can cause corrosion of internal components and degradation of properties such as electrical resistance, thermal conductivity, physical strength, and size. The switch is rated to withstand from 5- to 95-percent (non-condensing) relative humidity. Buildings in which the climate is controlled by air-conditioning in the warmer months and by heat during the colder months usually maintain an acceptable level of humidity for the switch equipment. However, if the switch is located in an unusually humid location, you should use a dehumidifier to maintain the humidity within an acceptable range. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 7 Altitude Requirements This switch is rated to operate at altitudes from 0 to 13,123 feet (0 to 4,000 meters). If you operate this switch at a higher altitude (low pressure), the efficiency of forced and convection cooling is reduced and can result in electrical problems that are related to arcing and corona effects. This condition can also cause sealed components with internal pressure, such as electrolytic capacitors, to fail or to perform at a reduced efficiency. Dust and Particulate Requirements Exhaust fans cool power supplies and system fans cool switches by drawing in air and exhausting air out through various openings in the chassis. However, fans also ingest dust and other particles, causing contaminant buildup in the switch and increased internal chassis temperature. A clean operating environment can greatly reduce the negative effects of dust and other particles, which act as insulators and interfere with the mechanical components in the switch. In addition to regular cleaning, follow these precautions to avoid contamination of your switch: • Do not permit smoking near the switch. • Do not permit food or drink near the switch. Minimizing Electromagnetic and Radio Frequency Interference Electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) from the switch can adversely affect other devices, such as radio and television (TV) receivers, operating near the switch. Radio frequencies that emanate from the switch can also interfere with cordless and low-power telephones. Conversely, RFI from high-power telephones can cause spurious characters to appear on the switch monitor. RFI is defined as any EMI with a frequency above 10 kHz. This type of interference can travel from the switch to other devices through the power cable and power source or through the air as transmitted radio waves. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) publishes specific regulations to limit the amount of EMI and RFI that can be emitted by computing equipment. Each switch meets these FCC regulations. To reduce the possibility of EMI and RFI, follow these guidelines: • Cover all open expansion slots with a blank filler plate. • Always use shielded cables with metal connector shells for attaching peripherals to the switch. When wires are run for any significant distance in an electromagnetic field, interference can occur between the field and the signals on the wires with the following implications: • Bad wiring can result in radio interference emanating from the plant wiring. • Strong EMI, especially when it is caused by lightning or radio transmitters, can destroy the signal drivers and receivers in the chassis and even create an electrical hazard by conducting power surges through lines into equipment. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 8 Preparing the Site Altitude Requirements To predict and prevent strong EMI, you might need to consult experts in radio frequency interference (RFI). Note The wiring is unlikely to emit radio interference if you use twisted-pair cable with a good distribution of grounding conductors. If you exceed the recommended distances, use a high-quality twisted-pair cable with one ground conductor for each data signal when applicable. If the wires exceed the recommended distances, or if wires pass between buildings, give special consideration to the effect of a lightning strike in your vicinity. The electromagnetic pulse caused by lightning or other high-energy phenomena can easily couple enough energy into unshielded conductors to destroy electronic switches. You might want to consult experts in electrical surge suppression and shielding if you had similar problems in the past. Caution Shock and Vibration Requirements The switch has been shock- and vibration-tested for operating ranges, handling, and earthquake standards. Grounding Requirements The switch is sensitive to variations in voltage supplied by the power sources. Overvoltage, undervoltage, and transients (or spikes) can erase data from memory or cause components to fail. To protect against these types of problems, ensure that there is an earth-ground connection for the switch. You can connect the grounding pad on the switch either directly to the earth-ground connection or to a fully bonded and grounded rack. When you properly install the chassis in a grounded rack, the switch is grounded because it has a metal-to-metal connection to the rack. Alternatively, you can ground the chassis by using a customer-supplied grounding cable that meets your local and national installation requirements (we recommend 6-AWG wire for U.S. installations) connected to the chassis with a grounding lug (provided in the switch accessory kit) and to the facility ground. You automatically ground AC power supplies when you connect them to AC power sources. For DC power supplies, you must connect a grounding wire when wiring the power supply to the DC power source. Note Planning for Power Requirements To plan for the power requirements of a switch, you must determine each of the following: • Power requirements for all of the switch components • Minimum number of power supplies required to power the components installed in the switch • Power mode to use and the number of additional power supplies required for that mode Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 9 Preparing the Site Shock and Vibration Requirements You must also ensure that the circuit used for the switch is dedicated to the switch to minimize the possibility of circuit failure. Also, ensure that the switch uses either AC or DC power sources, not a mix of AC and DC power sources. When you know the amount of power that is required for operations (available power) and redundancy (reserve power), you can plan for the required number of input power receptacles within reach of the switch location. Step 1 Determine the power requirement for the modules in the switch by summing the maximum wattage for each installed module (see the following table).

The total is 6786 W. Step 2 Determine the number of power supplies required to power the modules installed in the switch by dividing the module power requirement amount (see Step 1) by the output wattage (3000 W) of the power supplies installed in the switch. Round up the fractional result to the nearest ones digit. For example, if you are installing a switch with a maximum consumption of 6786 W, you need three power supplies (6786 W / 3000 W = 2.26 [rounded up to 3 power supplies]) to operate the switch and its modules. Step 3 Determine the amount of power required from a power source. The power supplies are rated to have at least 91 percent efficiency. • To determine the input power (Watts) from the power source to the power supplies, divide the output power of each power supply (3000 W) by the efficiency of the power supply (0.91) and then multiply the result by the number of power supplies required to power the switch. For example, if the switch uses 3 power supplies, you can calculate the amount of power required from the power source as follows: 3000 W output / 0.91 efficiency X 3 power supplies = 9891 W • To determine the number of Amps (A) required to power the switch, divide the maximum Watts required for by the voltage used as shown in the following examples: ◦For 9891 A at 200 volts AC (VAC), use the following formula: (9891 W)/(200 VAC) = 33 A ◦For 9891 A at 277 volts AC (VAC), use the following formula: (9891 W)/(277 VAC) = 23.8 A ◦For 9891 A at 380 volts DC (VDC), use the following formula: (9891 W)/(380 VDC) = 17.4 A • To determine the required BTUs, multiply the Watts required for the power source by 3.41214163. For example, for 9891 W, use the following formula: (9891 W) X (3.41214163 BTU) = 22,496 Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 13 Preparing the Site Planning for Power Requirements To size the circuit breaker for the required amperage, you must also divide the required amperage by the percentage. For example, if the switch requires an input amperage of 33 A and you are able to use up to 80 percent of the capacity of a circuit breaker, you use the following formula to calculate the minimum amperage required of the circuit breaker: (33 A)/ (80 % or 0.80) = 41.25 amps Step 4 Select one of the following power modes to determine the number of additional power supplies required for reserve power: • Combined power—Do not add any power supplies to the number of power supplies calculated for the available power in Step 2. This power mode does not provide power redundancy, so no extra power supplies are needed. • n+1 redundancy—Add one power supply (reserve power supply) that can output as much power as the most powerful power supply used for active power. This form of power redundancy provides a reserve power supply that can replace any active power supply that goes offline. • n+n redundancy—Add enough power supplies (reserve power supplies) to at least equal the total output of the active power supplies (the number of power supplies calculated in Step 2). Typically, you double the number of power supplies. You must plan for a second power source for the reserve power supplies. For example, if you calculate that you need two 3-kW power supplies for 6 kW of available power, you need another two 3-kW power supplies for 6 kW of reserve power (for a total of four 3-kW power supplies used for available and reserve power). Step 5 Be sure that the power source circuits are dedicated to the switch and not to other electrical equipment. For combined mode or n+1 redundancy mode, you need only one dedicated circuit. For n+n redundancy, you must have two dedicated power circuits, with each circuit powering half of the 3-kW power supplies. The requirements for each circuit are listed in the following table. Requirement for Each Circuit Number of CircuitsPower Supply 16 A at 200 to 240 VAC1 (combined mode or n+1 redundancy mode) 2 (n+n redundancy mode) 3-kW AC power supply (N9K-PAC-3000W-B) AC power: 200 to 277 VAC DC power: 240 to 380 VDC 1 (combined mode or n+1 redundancy mode) 2 (n+n redundancy mode) 3-kW Universal AC/DC power supply (N9K-PUV-3000W-B) 45A at -40 to -75 VDC (-48 VDC nominal US) (-60 VDC nominal international) 1 (combined mode or n+1 redundancy mode) 2 (n+n redundancy mode) 3-kW DC power supply (N9K-PDC-3000W-B) Step 6 Plan the placement of the input power receptacles within reach of the power cables used for each power supply (see the following table for the maximum distances). Typically, power receptacles are placed on the rack with the switch. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 14 Preparing the Site Planning for Power Requirements Maximum Distance Between Receptacle and Power SupplyPower Supply 8 to 12 feet (2.5 to 3.5 m)3-kW AC power supplies 14 feet (4.27 m)3-kW Universal AC/DC power supplies Customer provides four 6-gauge wires (recommended) and cuts that wire to the required length. Cisco provides four 6-gauge lugs to connect those wires to the DC power supply. 3-kW DC power supplies All power supplies installed in the same switch must be powered by either AC power sources or DC power sources, not by a mix of AC and DC power sources. Note Rack and Cabinet Requirements You can install the following types of racks or cabinets for your switch: • Standard perforated cabinets • Solid-walled cabinets with a roof fan tray (bottom-to-top cooling) • Standard open four-post Telco racks To correctly install the switch in a cabinet that is located in a hot-aisle/cold-aisle environment, you should fit the cabinet with baffles to prevent exhaust air from recirculating into the chassis air intake. Work with your cabinet vendors to determine which of their cabinets meet the following requirements or see the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) for recommendations: • Use a standard 19-inch (48.3-cm), four-post Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) cabinet or rack with mounting rails that conform to English universal hole spacing per section 1 of the ANSI/EIA-310-D-1992 standard. • The height of the rack or cabinet must accommodate the 13-RU (22.7 inches or 57.8 cm) height of the switch and its bottom support bracket. • The depth of a four-post rack must be 24 to 32 inches (61.0 to 81.3 cm) between the front and rear mounting rails (for proper mounting of the bottom-support brackets or other mounting hardware). • Required clearances between the chassis and the edges of its rack or the interior of its cabinet are as follows: ◦4.5 inches (11.4 cm) between the front of the chassis and the front of the rack or interior of the cabinet (required for cabling and module handles). ◦3.0 inches (7.6 cm) between the rear of the chassis and the interior of the cabinet (required for airflow in the cabinet if used). ◦No clearance is required between the chassis and the sides of the rack or cabinet (no side airflow). Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 15 Preparing the Site Rack and Cabinet Requirements Additionally, you must consider the following site requirements for the rack: • Power receptacles must be located within reach of the power cords used with the switch. ◦Power cords for the 3-kW AC power supplies are 8 to 12 feet (2.5 to 4.3 m) long. ◦Power cords for the 3-kW Universal AC power supplies are 14 feet (4.27 m) long. The power cables for the 3-kW DC power supply are provided by and sized by customers.Note • Clearance is required for cables that connect to as many as 384 ports (in addition to the cabling required for other devices in the same rack). These cables must not block access to any removable chassis modules or block airflow into or out of the chassis. Route the cables through the cable management frames on the left and right sides of the chassis. Additionally, you must have power receptacles located within reach of the power cords used with the switch. Statement 1048—Rack Stabilization Stability hazard. The rack stabilizing mechanism must be in place, or the rack must be bolted to the floor before you slide the unit out for servicing. Failure to stabilize the rack can cause the rack to tip over. Warning Clearance Requirements You must provide the chassis with adequate clearance between the chassis and any other rack, device, or structure so that you can properly install the chassis, route cables, provide airflow, and maintain the switch. For the clearances required for an installation of this chassis, see the following figure.

Statement 1048—Rack Stabilization Stability hazard. The rack stabilizing mechanism must be in place, or the rack must be bolted to the floor before you slide the unit out for servicing. Failure to stabilize the rack can cause the rack to tip over. Warning Statement 1018—Supply Circuit Take care when connecting units to the supply circuit so that wiring is not overloaded. Warning Step 1 Bolt the rack to the subfloor before moving the chassis onto it. Step 2 If the rack has bonded construction, connect it to the earth ground. This action enables you to easily ground the switch and its components and to ground your electrostatic discharge (ESD) wrist strap to prevent discharge damage when you handle ungrounded components during installation. Step 3 If you need access to the source power at the rack, include one of the following: Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 19 For AC power, include an AC circuit that meets the power specifications of the switch (see Power Requirements for Switch Modules, on page 117). This circuit must include receptacles that match your local and national requirements and match the needs of the power cable used with the power supply unit. • • For DC power, include a DC circuit that meets the power specifications of the switch see Power Requirements for Switch Modules, on page 117). This circuit must include a circuit breaker so that you can safely connect the power cables to the power supply. Inspecting the New Switch Before you install a new chassis, you need to unpack and inspect it to be sure that you have all the items that you ordered and verify that the switch was not damaged during shipment. When you handle the chassis or its components, you must follow ESD protocol at all times to prevent ESD damage. This protocol includes but is not limited to wearing an ESD wrist strap that you connect to the earth ground. Caution Do not discard the shipping container when you unpack the switch. Flatten the shipping cartons and store them with the pallet used for the system. If you need to move or ship the system in the future, you will need these containers. Tip Step 1 Compare the shipment to the equipment list that is provided by your customer service representative and verify that you have received all of the ordered items.

To maximize the stability of the rack, you must attach these rails at the lowest possible rack unit (RU). Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 23 Installing a Chassis Installing the Bottom-Support Rails Statement 1006—Chassis Warning for Rack-Mounting and Servicing To prevent bodily injury when mounting or servicing this unit in a rack, you must take special precautions to ensure that the system remains stable. The following guidelines are provided to ensure your safety: Warning • This unit should be mounted at the bottom of the rack if it is the only unit in the rack. • When mounting this unit in a partially filled rack, load the rack from the bottom to the top with the heaviest component at the bottom of the rack. • If the rack is provided with stabilizing devices, install the stabilizers before mounting or servicing the unit in the rack. Before You Begin Before you can install the bottom support rails for the chassis, you must do the following: • Verify that a four-post rack or cabinet is installed and secured to the concrete subfloor (see Installing a Rack or Cabinet). • If any other devices are stored in the rack or cabinet, verify that they are located below where you plan to install the switch. Also, verify that lighter devices in the same rack are located above where you plan to install this switch. • Verify that the bottom-support rails kit is included in the switch accessory kit (see Inspecting the New Switch). Step 1 Position one of the two adjustable bottom-support rails at the lowest possible RU in the rack or cabinet and adjust the length of each rail so that it stretches from the outer edges of the front and rear vertical mounting rails on the rack. Be sure there is at least 13 RU (22.75 in [57.8 cm]) of vertical space above the rails to install the chassis (see the following figure). You can expand the rail so that its mounting brackets are spaced between 24 to 32 inches (61.0 to 81.3 cm). Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 24 Installing a Chassis Installing the Bottom-Support Rails Distance between front and rear vertical rails must be 24 to 32 inches (61.0 to 81.3 cm). 3Position 2 bottom-support rails at the lowest RU on the rack. 1 Allow at least 13 RU (22.7 in [57.8 cm]) for each chassis. 2 Step 2 Attach the bottom-support rail to the rack or cabinet using a Phillips torque screwdriver on three M6 x 19 mm or 12-24 x 3/4 inch screws for each end of the rail (using a total of 6 screws for the rail as shown in the following figure) and tighten each screw to 40 in-lbs (4.5 N.m) of torque.

Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 26 Installing a Chassis Installing a Chassis in a Rack or Cabinet • If there are other devices in the rack, verify that the devices that are heavier than this chassis are installed below where you are going to install the chassis and that the lighter devices are installed above where you are going to install the chassis. • Verify that the data center ground is accessible where you are installing the chassis. • Verify that you have the following tools and equipment: ◦Mechanical lift capable of lifting the full weight of the chassis and its installed modules The chassis can weigh up to 395 pounds (179 kg) when it is fully loaded. You can lighten the chassis for easier moving by removing its power supplies, fan trays, and fabric modules. To determine the full weight of the chassis and the appropriate weight rating for the mechanical lift, see Weights and Quantities for the Chassis, Modules, Fan Trays, and Power Supplies, on page 114. Note You must use a mechanical lift to elevate a switch that weighs over 120 pounds (55 kg).Caution ◦Phillips-head torque screwdriver ◦Bottom-support rails kit (shipped with the accessory kit) Part of this kit has already been used to install the bottom-support rails. You should still have eight 12-24 x 3/4-inch or M6 x 19 mm Phillips screws, which are required for attaching the chassis to the rack. You should also have at least two persons to push the chassis and one person to guide the chassis when you slide it into the rack. Note Statement 1006—Chassis Warning for Rack-Mounting and Servicing To prevent bodily injury when mounting or servicing this unit in a rack, you must take special precautions to ensure that the system remains stable. The following guidelines are provided to ensure your safety: Warning • This unit should be mounted at the bottom of the rack if it is the only unit in the rack. • When mounting this unit in a partially filled rack, load the rack from the bottom to the top with the heaviest component at the bottom of the rack. • If the rack is provided with stabilizing devices, install the stabilizers before mounting or servicing the unit in the rack. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 27 Installing a Chassis Installing a Chassis in a Rack or Cabinet Statement 1074—Comply with Local and National Electrical Codes Installation of the equipment must comply with local and national electrical codes. Warning Step 1 If you need to make the chassis as light as possible for moving, remove the following modules and place them where their connectors will not be damaged: • Power supplies—For each power supply, press and hold the eject lever, and use the handle on the front of the power supply to pull the power supply out of the chassis. • Fan trays—Unscrew the four captive screws, and use the two handles on the fan tray to pull the fan tray out of the chassis. • Fabric modules—For each fabric module, keep your face at least 12 inches (30 cm) away from the modules, press both eject buttons on the front, rotate both levers away from the front of the module, use the levers to pull the module out of the chassis. Step 2 Load the chassis onto a mechanical lift as follows: a) Position the mechanical lift next to the shipping pallet that holds the chassis. b) Elevate the lift platform to the level of the bottom of the chassis (or no more than 1/4 inch [0.635 cm] below the bottom of the chassis). c) Use at least two persons to slide the chassis fully onto the lift so that the side of the chassis touches or is close to the vertical rails on the lift. Make sure that the front and rear of the chassis are unobstructed so you can easily push the chassis into the rack. Statement 1032—Lifting the Chassis To prevent personal injury or damage to the chassis, never attempt to lift or tilt the chassis using the handles on modules (such as power supplies, fans, or cards); these types of handles are not designed to support the weight of the unit. Warning To lift the chassis, use a mechanical lift. Do not use the handles on the side of the chassis (the handles are not rated for lifting over 200 pounds [91 kg]). Use the side handles for only repositioning the chassis after it is already on the mechanical lift or in the rack or cabinet. Note Step 3 Use the mechanical lift to move and align the rear of the chassis to the front of the four-post rack or cabinet. Make sure that the bottom of the chassis is elevated to the height of the bottom-support rails or no more than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) above the bracket. Step 4 Push the chassis halfway onto the rack or cabinet. Use at least two persons to push the chassis onto the bottom-support rails and one person to guide the chassis down the center of the rails. Push the lower half of the front side of the chassis so that the back side enters the rack first, and push until the chassis is halfway onto the rack (see the following figure). Ensure that the chassis does not get caught on any of the expansion edges of the bottom-support rail. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 28 Installing a Chassis Installing a Chassis in a Rack or Cabinet Rack vertical mounting rails on the rack.3Push the sides of the lower half of the front side of the chassis (do not push on any of the modules or module handles). 1 Bottom-support rails4Chassis mounting brackets.2 To adjust the placement of the chassis on the bottom-support rails, you can use the chassis handles (see Callout 1 in the following figure). Tip Step 5 If the mechanical lift is raised above the height of the bottom-support rails, gently lower it to the level of the rails or no more than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) below the rails. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 29 Installing a Chassis Installing a Chassis in a Rack or Cabinet This action helps to prevent the bottom of the chassis from getting caught on the expansion edges of the bottom-support rails. Step 6 Push the chassis all the way onto the rack so that the vertical mounting brackets on the front of the chassis come in contact with the vertical mounting rails on the rack. Step 7 Use four M6 x 19 mm or 24 x 3/4-inch screws to attach each of the two chassis vertical mounting brackets to the two rack vertical mounting rails (total of eight screws). See Callout 2 in the following figure. Four M6 x 19 mm or 10-24 x 3/4 in.

Grounding the Chassis The switch chassis is automatically grounded when you properly install the switch in a grounded rack with metal-to-metal connections between the switch and rack. You can alternatively ground the chassis (this is required if the rack is not grounded) by attaching a customer-supplied grounding cable to the chassis grounding pad and the facility ground. Statement 1024—Ground Conductor This equipment must be grounded. Never defeat the ground conductor or operate the equipment in the absence of a suitably installed ground conductor. Contact the appropriate electrical inspection authority or an electrician if you are uncertain that suitable grounding is available. Warning Statement 1046—Installing or Replacing the Unit When installing or replacing the unit, the ground connection must always be made first and disconnected last. Warning Before You Begin Before you can ground the chassis, you must have a connection to the earth ground for the data center building. Step 1 Use a wire-stripping tool to remove approximately 0.75 inch (19 mm) of the covering from the end of the grounding wire. Step 2 Insert the stripped end of the grounding wire into the open end of the grounding lug, and use a crimping tool to crimp the lug to the wire (see Callout 2 in the following figure). Verify that the ground wire is securely attached to the grounding lug by attempting to pull the wire out of the crimped lug. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 31 Installing a Chassis Grounding the Chassis 2 M4 screws used to secure the grounding lug to the chassis 3Chassis grounding pad1 Grounding cable, with 0.75 in. (19 mm) of insulation stripped from one end, inserted into the grounding lug and crimped in place 2 Step 3 Secure the grounding lug to the chassis grounding pad with two M4 screws (see Callouts 1 and 3 in the previous figure), and tighten the screws to 11 to 15 in-lb (1.24 to 1.69 N·m) of torque. Step 4 Prepare the other end of the grounding wire and connect it to the facility ground. Starting Up the Switch Before you can turn on the switch, you must ensure the following: • The switch has enough power supplies to output the amount of wattage required for all of the modules installed in the switch. Depending on the power mode that you use for the switch, you need to consider the following: ◦For combined power mode (no power redundancy), there must be enough power supplies to power all of the modules in the chassis (no extra power supplies are needed for redundancy). ◦For n+1 redundancy mode, there must be enough power supplies to power all of the modules in the chassis and there must be one extra power supply to provide redundancy if one power supply goes down or is replaced. The maximum number of power supplies needed is the number used for combined power mode plus one (n+1) for redundancy. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 32 Installing a Chassis Starting Up the Switch ◦For n+n redundancy mode, there must be two equal sets of power supplies, each of which can power all of the modules in the chassis and each set is connected to a separate power source. If one power source goes down, the power supplies connected to the other power source can power the switch. The maximum number of power supplies is the number of power supplies required for combined power plus the same number of power supplies (n+n) for redundancy. DC power supplies have two power feeds, each with a positive (+) wire and a negative (-) wire. For simpler routing of power cables, you should connect both feeds to the same power source. Alternatively, you can connect each feed to a separate power source but that makes the routing of power cables more complicated. Note • When using two power sources, it is easiest to manage the routing of power cables if you route the power cables for one power source along the left side of the chassis and route the power cables for the other power source along the right side of the chassis. The power cables on the left side should connect to power supplies in the left-most power supply slots, and the power cables on the right side should connect to power supplies in the right-most power supply slots. If you are not filling all of the power supply slots, fill the slots on the sides for now and leave the middle slots open (covered with power supply slot blanks to preserve the designed airflow) until you need to add more power supplies. All power supplies must be powered by either AC power sources or DC power sources, not by a mix of AC and DC power sources. Note You turn on the switch as soon as you connect its power supplies to one or two power sources. Statement 1004—Installation Instructions Read the installation instructions before connecting the system to the power source. Warning Statement 1018—Supply Circuit Take care when connecting units to the supply circuit so that wiring is not overloaded. Warning Connecting a 3-kW AC Power Supply to an AC Power Source Step 1 For each 3-kW AC power supply, connect an AC power cable to the AC power source and to the power receptacle on the power supply. Step 2 Verify that the Output Power LED turns on and becomes green. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 33 Installing a Chassis Connecting a 3-kW AC Power Supply to an AC Power Source What to Do Next When the power supplies are operating and the switch is fully powered, you are ready to connect the switch to the network. Connecting a 3-kW Universal AC/DC Power Supply to an AC Power Source The 3-kW Universal AC/DC power supply can be connected to either a 200-to-277-V AC circuit equipped with a Saf-D-Grid receptacle. This procedure is for connecting the power supply to an AC power source. Before You Begin The power switch on the power supply must be turned off (power switch set to 0). Step 1 Verify that the power switch on the power supply is turned off (0). Step 2 Connect the Saf-D-Grid connector on the AC power cable to the Saf-D-Grid receptacle for the AC power source. Step 3 Connect the Saf-D-Grid connector on the other end of the power cable to the Saf-D-Grid receptacle on the power supply. Step 4 Turn on the power supply by pressing its power switch to on (1). Step 5 Verify that the Output Power LED turns on and becomes green. What to Do Next After you finish connecting all of the power supplies to power sources and each of the power supplies is operating, you are ready to connect the switch to the network. Connecting a 3-kW Universal AC/DC Power Supply to a DC Power Source The 3-kW Universal AC/DC power supply can be connected to a 240-to-380-V DC circuit equipped with positive, negative, and ground terminals. This procedure is for connecting the power supply to a DC power source. Before You Begin • The DC power source must be turned off at its circuit breaker. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 34 Installing a Chassis Connecting a 3-kW Universal AC/DC Power Supply to an AC Power Source • The power switch on the power supply must be turned off (power switch set to 0). Step 1 Verify that the circuit breaker for the DC power source is turned off. Step 2 Verify that the power switch on the power supply is turned off (0). Step 3 Connect the ground terminal ring on the power cable to the ground terminal on the DC power source and secure it in place with a nut tightened to the appropriate torque setting for the terminal post. Step 4 Connect the negative terminal ring on the power cable to the negative (-) terminal on the DC power source and secure it in place with a nut tightened to the appropriate torque setting for the terminal post. Step 5 Connect the positive terminal ring on the power cable to the negative (+) terminal on the DC power source and secure it in place with a nut tightened to the appropriate torque setting for the terminal post. Step 6 Connect the Saf-D-Grid connector on the other end of the power cable to the Saf-D-Grid receptacle on the power supply. Step 7 Turn on the circuit breaker for the DC power source circuit. Step 8 Turn on the power supply by pressing its power switch to on (1). Step 9 Verify that the Output Power LED turns on and becomes green. What to Do Next After you finish connecting all of the power supplies to power sources and each of the power supplies is operating, you are ready to connect the switch to the network. Connecting a 3-kW DC Power Supply to a DC Power Source If you are not using power redundancy or are using n+1 power redundancy, you connect all of the power supplies in the switch to the same power grid. If you are using n+n power redundancy, you connect half of the power supplies to one power grid and the other half of power supplies to another power grid (grid A power supplies are on the left side of the switch and grid B power supplies are on the right side of the switch). Before You Begin • The power supplies must already be installed in the chassis. • The power supplies must be close enough to be connected to the DC power source using the customer-provided power cables. • Four 6-AWG lugs provided with the switch. • Customer-provided equipment and tools must include all of the following: ◦Four power cables (6 AWG cables recommended). If you use colors to designate positive and negative cables, you need two cables colored for positive polarity and two cables colored for negative polarity. Note ◦Wire stripping tool ◦Crimping tool Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 35 Installing a Chassis Connecting a 3-kW DC Power Supply to a DC Power Source ◦Torque screwdriver and wrench Step 1 Turn off the switch and circuit breaker as follows: a) Turn the power switch on the power supply to standby (labeled 0 on the power supply). b) Turn off the circuit breaker for each of the two power inputs coming from the DC power source. Statement 1003—DC Power Disconnection Before performing any of the following procedures, ensure that power is removed from the DC circuit. Warning Step 2 Connect the four customer-provided power cables to the power supply and power source as follows: a) Use a wire stripper to remove 0.75 inches (19 cm) of insulation from the end of each of four power cables. If you are using different colored cables for positive and negative polarity, be sure that you have two of each color (2 positive cables and 2 negative cables). b) Use a crimping tool to attach each of four lugs (provided with the switch for each power supply) to the stripped end of each cable. Test each crimped lug by trying to pull it off its cable. c) Use a torque screwdriver to unscrew three screws on the cover for the terminal box that is located on the front of the power supply and lift off the cover as shown in the following figure. Remove the cover.2Unscrew three screws on the safety cover.1 Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 36 Installing a Chassis Connecting a 3-kW DC Power Supply to a DC Power Source The terminal box has four slots for four power terminals (ordered as negative [-], positive [+], positive [+], and negative [-]). Each terminal has two nuts that you use to fasten a power cable to the terminal. Note d) Remove the two nuts from each terminal post in each slot of the terminal box. e) Place each of the lugs for the two positive cables on the terminal posts for the positive slots (two middle slots) of the terminal box and fasten each lug using two nuts tightened to 40 in-lb (4.5 N·m) of torque. f) Place each of the lugs for the two negative cables on the terminal posts for the negative slots (two side slots) of the terminal box and fasten each lug using two nuts tightened to 40 in-lb (4.5 N·m) of torque. g) Replace the safety cover on the terminal box and fasten it in place using its three screws. h) Connect the other ends of the power cables to the two DC power circuits. Be sure that the positive and negative cables attached to one side of the power supply are attached to the same DC power source circuit (with the negative cable attached to a negative terminal and with the positive cable attached to a positive terminal). Step 3 Power up the power supply as follows: a) Turn on the power source circuit breaker for both input lines. Verify that the Input 1 (IN1) and Input 2 (IN2) LEDs light up on the power supply. b) Turn the power switch on the power supply to ON (labeled 1 on the power supply). The LEDs should flash and then the OK LED should turn on (green) in addition to the Input LEDs. What to Do Next You are ready to connect the switch to the network. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 37 Installing a Chassis Connecting a 3-kW DC Power Supply to a DC Power Source Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 38 Installing a Chassis Connecting a 3-kW DC Power Supply to a DC Power Source CHAPTER 4 Connecting the Switch to the Network • Guidelines for Connecting Ports, page 39 • Connecting a Console to the Switch, page 40 • Connecting the Management Interface, page 42 • Creating the Initial Switch Configuration, page 42 • Connecting Interface Ports, page 44 Guidelines for Connecting Ports You can use C Form-factor Pluggable (CFP), Quad Small Form-Factor Pluggable (QSFP+ or QSFP28), or Small Form-Factor Pluggable (SFP, SFP+ or SFP28) transceivers or RJ-45 connectors to connect the ports on the line cards to other network devices. For information about the transceivers currently being used with the switch, use the show inventory all command. To prevent damage to the fiber-optic cables that can separate from their cables, we recommend that you keep the transceivers disconnected from their fiber-optic cables when installing the transceiver in the line card. Before removing such a transceiver from the switch, remove the cable from the transceiver. To maximize the effectiveness and life of your transceivers and optical cables, do the following: • Wear an ESD-preventative wrist strap that is connected to an earth ground whenever handling transceivers. The switch is typically grounded during installation and provides an ESD port to which you can connect your wrist strap. • Do not remove and insert a transceiver more often than is necessary. Repeated removals and insertions can shorten its useful life. • Keep the transceivers and fiber-optic cables clean and dust free to maintain high signal accuracy and to prevent damage to the connectors. Attenuation (loss of light) is increased by contamination and should be kept below 0.35 dB. ◦Clean these parts before installation to prevent dust from scratching the fiber-optic cable ends. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 39 ◦Clean the connectors regularly; the required frequency of cleaning depends upon the environment. In addition, clean connectors if they are exposed to dust or accidentally touched. Both wet and dry cleaning techniques can be effective; refer to your site's fiber-optic connection cleaning procedures. ◦Do not touch the ends of connectors. Touching the ends can leave fingerprints and cause other contamination. • Inspect routinely for dust and damage. If you suspect damage, clean and then inspect fiber ends under a microscope to determine if damage has occurred. • To minimize the chance of damaging transceivers when installing them, slide them gently into their switch slots and never force them all the way into the slots. If the transceiver stops part way into the slot, it might be upside down and you should remove the transceiver before turning it over and reinstalling it. If positioned correctly, the transceiver will slide all the way into the slot and click when fully installed. Statement 1051—Laser Radiation Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from disconnected fibers or connectors. Do not stare into beams or view directly with optical instruments. Warning Statement 1053—Class 1M Laser Radiation Class 1M laser radiation when open. Do not view directly with optical instruments. Warning Statement 1055—Class I and Class 1M Laser Class I (CDRH) and Class 1M (IEC) laser products. Warning Statement 1056—Unterminated Fiber Cable Invisible laser radiation may be emitted from the end of the unterminated fiber cable or connector. Do not view directly with optical instruments. Viewing the laser output with certain optical instruments (for example, eye loupes, magnifiers, and microscopes) within a distance of 100 mm may pose an eye hazard. Warning Connecting a Console to the Switch Before you create a network management connection for the switch or connect the switch to the network, you must create a local management connection through a console terminal and configure an IP address for the switch. You also can use the console to perform the following functions, each of which can be performed through the management interface after you make that connection: • Configure the switch using the command-line interface (CLI). • Monitor network statistics and errors. • Configure Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agent parameters. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 40 Connecting the Switch to the Network Connecting a Console to the Switch • Download software updates. You make this local management connection between the asynchronous serial port on a supervisor module and a console device capable of asynchronous transmission. Typically, you can use a computer terminal as the console device. On the supervisor modules, you use the console serial port. Before you can connect the console port to a computer terminal, make sure that the computer terminal supports VT100 terminal emulation. The terminal emulation software makes communication between the switch and computer possible during setup and configuration. Note Before You Begin • The switch must be fully installed in its rack, connected to a power source, and grounded. • The necessary cabling for the console, management, and network connections must be available. ◦An RJ-45 rollover cable and DB9F/RJ-45 adapter are provided in the switch accessory kit. ◦Network cabling should already be routed to the location of the installed switch. Step 1 Configure the console device to match the following default port characteristics: • 9600 baud • 8 data bits • 1 stop bit • No parity Step 2 Connect an RJ-45 rollover cable to the console port on the switch. You can find this cable in the accessory kit. Step 3 Route the RJ-45 rollover cable to the console or modem. Step 4 Connect the other end of the RJ-45 rollover cable to the console or to a modem. If the console or modem cannot use an RJ-45 connection, use the DB-9F/RJ-45F PC terminal adapter found in the accessory kit for the switch. Alternatively, you can use an RJ-45/DSUB F/F or RJ-45/DSUB R/P adapter, but you must provide those adapters. What to Do Next You are ready to create the initial switch configuration (see Creating the Initial Switch Configuration, on page 42). Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 41 Connecting the Switch to the Network Connecting a Console to the Switch Connecting the Management Interface The supervisor management port (MGMT ETH) provides out-of-band management, which enables you to use the command-line interface (CLI) to manage the switch by its IP address. This port uses a 10/100/1000 Ethernet connection with an RJ-45 interface. In a dual supervisor switch, you can ensure that the active supervisor module is always connected to the network by connecting the management interface on both supervisor modules to the network (that is, you can perform this task for each supervisor module). No matter which supervisor module is active, the switch automatically has a management interface that is running and accessible from the network. Note To prevent an IP address conflict, do not connect the management port until the initial configuration is complete. For more information, see Creating the Initial Switch Configuration, on page 42. Caution Before You Begin You must have completed the initial switch configuration (see Creating the Initial Switch Configuration, on page 42). Step 1 Connect a modular, RJ-45, UTP cable to the MGMT ETH port on the supervisor module. Step 2 Route the cable through the central slot in the cable management system. Step 3 Connect the other end of the cable to a 10/100/1000 Ethernet port on a network device. What to Do Next You are ready to connect the interface ports on each of the line cards to the network. Creating the Initial Switch Configuration You must assign an IP address to the switch management interface so that you can then connect the switch to the network. When you initially power up the switch, it boots up and asks you a series of questions to configure the switch. To enable you to connect the switch to the network, you can use the default choices for each configuration except the IP address, which you must provide. You can perform the other configurations at a later time as described in the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Fundamentals Configuration Guide. You should also know the unique name needed to identify the switch among the devices in the network.Note Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 42 Connecting the Switch to the Network Connecting the Management Interface Before You Begin • A console device must be connected with the switch. • The switch must be connected to a power source. • Determine the IP address and netmask needed for the Management (Mgmt0) interface. Step 1 Power up the switch by connecting each installed power supply to an AC circuit. If you are using the combined or power-supply (n+1) power mode, connect all of the power supplies to the same AC circuit. If you are using the input-source (n+n) power mode, connect half of the power supplies to one AC circuit and the other half to another AC circuit. The Input and Output LEDs on each power supply light up (green) when the power supply units are sending power to the switch, and the software asks you to specify a password to use with the switch. Step 2 Enter a new password to use for this switch. The software checks the security strength of your password and rejects your password if it is not considered to be a strong password. To increase the security strength of your password, make sure that it adheres to the following guidelines: • At least eight characters • Minimizes or avoids the use of consecutive characters (such as \"abcd\") • Minimizes or avoids repeating characters (such as \"aaabbb\") • Does not contain recognizable words from the dictionary • Does not contain proper names • Contains both uppercase and lowercase characters • Contains numbers as well as letters Examples of strong passwords include the following: • If2CoM18 • 2004AsdfLkj30 • Cb1955S21 Clear text passwords cannot include the dollar sign ($) special character.Note If a password is trivial (such as a short, easy-to-decipher password), the software will reject your password configuration. Be sure to configure a strong password as explained in this step. Passwords are case sensitive. Tip If you enter a strong password, the software asks you to confirm the password. Step 3 Enter the same password again. If you enter the same password, the software accepts the password and begins asking a series of configuration questions. Step 4 Until you are asked for an IP address, you can enter the default configuration for each question. Repeat this step for each question until you are asked for the Mgmt0 IPv4 address. Step 5 Enter the IP address for the management interface. The software asks for the Mgmt0 IPv4 netmask. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 43 Connecting the Switch to the Network Creating the Initial Switch Configuration Step 6 Enter a network mask for the management interface. The software asks if you need to edit the configuration. Step 7 Enter no to not edit the configuration. The software asks if you need to save the configuration. Step 8 Enter yes to save the configuration. What to Do Next You can now set up the management interface for each supervisor module on the switch. Connecting Interface Ports You can connect BASE-T (copper) and optical interface ports on line cards with other devices for network connectivity. Connecting a BASE-T Port to the Network You can connect an line-card BASE-T (copper) port to another device on the network using a copper network interface cable with RJ-45 connectors on either end. Before You Begin • You must follow the ESD-preventative protocol, such as wearing a grounded ESD wrist strap, whenever handling electronic components. • You must have BASE-T ports available for connection on a line card installed on the switch. • You must have BASE-T ports available on another networked device, which can be another switch. Step 1 Route the copper interface cable from the other networking device to the switch. At the switch, route the cable through the cable management slot next to the line card that you are connecting. Step 2 Insert the RJ-45 connector for the new interface cable into the appropriate port on the line card. Check the port LED to be sure that it turns on and turns green. Disconnecting a BASE-T Port from the Network You can disconnect a BASE-T (copper) port from the network by removing a copper network interface cable with RJ-45 connectors from the line card interface port. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 44 Connecting the Switch to the Network Connecting Interface Ports Before You Begin You must follow ESD-preventative protocol, such as wearing a grounded ESD wrist strap, whenever handling electronic components. Step 1 Remove the RJ-45 connector from the interface port that you are disconnecting on the line card. The port LED turns off. Step 2 (Optional) You can remove the interface cable from the device on the other end of the cable. Connecting an Optical Port to the Network Depending on the type line card that you are using, you can use 1-Gigabit SFP, 10-Gigabit SFP+, 25-Gigabit SFP28, 40-Gigabit QSFP+, or 100-Gigabit CFP2 or QSFP28 transceivers. Some of these transceivers work with fiber-optic cables that you attach to the transceivers and other transceivers work with preattached copper cables. To prolong the life of detachable transceivers, install the transceivers before installing the fiber-optic cable in the transceivers. The N9K-X9432PQ line card supports your use of SFP and SFP+ transceivers in QSFP+ ports when using a QSFP-to-SFP adapter, such as the CVS-QSFP-SFP10G adapter. Note Removing and installing a transceiver can shorten its useful life. Do not remove and insert transceivers more often than is absolutely necessary. We recommend that you disconnect cables before installing or removing transceivers to prevent damage to the cable or transceiver. Caution Step 1 If there is a protective cover for the port that you are connecting, remove the protective covering. Step 2 For the transceiver that you are inserting into a port, do the following: a) If the transceiver is connected to an optical cable, remove the cable from the transceiver. b) Insert the transceiver into the open port. c) If using an optical cable, insert the optical cable into the installed transceiver. Step 3 To install the other end of the cable into another device, do the following: a) If the transceiver is connected to an optical cable, remove the cable from the transceiver. b) Insert the transceiver into the open port. c) If using an optical cable, insert the optical cable into the installed transceiver. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 45 Connecting the Switch to the Network Connecting an Optical Port to the Network Disconnecting Optical Ports from the Network When removing fiber-optic transceivers, you must remove the fiber-optic cables from a transceiver before removing the transceiver from the port. Maintaining Transceivers and Optical Cables Transceivers and fiber-optic cables must be kept clean and dust free to maintain high signal accuracy and prevent damage to the connectors. Attenuation (loss of light) is increased by contamination and should be below 0.35 dB. Consider the following maintenance guidelines: • Transceivers are static sensitive. To prevent ESD damage, wear an ESD-preventative wrist strap that is connected to the grounded chassis. • Do not remove and insert a transceiver more often than is necessary. Repeated removals and insertions can shorten its useful life. • Keep all optical connections covered when not in use. Clean them before using to prevent dust from scratching the fiber-optic cable ends. • Do not touch the ends of connectors. Touching the ends can leave fingerprints and cause other contamination. • Clean the connectors regularly; the required frequency of cleaning depends upon the environment. In addition, clean connectors if they are exposed to dust or accidentally touched. Both wet and dry cleaning techniques can be effective; refer to your site's fiber-optic connection cleaning procedures. • Inspect routinely for dust and damage. If you suspect damage, clean and then inspect fiber ends under a microscope to determine if damage has occurred.

This information includes module type, bootup status, MAC addresses, serial numbers, software versions, and hardware versions. You can use this command in the following ways to display information about all of the installed modules or a specific module: Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 54 Managing the Switch Displaying the Current State of a Module • For information on all modules, use the show module command. • For information on a specific supervisor, system controller, line card, or fabric module, use the show module slot_number command to specify a slot number. To determine the slots to specify, use the show inventory command.Note This command reports on only software-controlled modules, such as supervisors, system controllers, line cards, fabric modules, fan trays, and power supplies. It does not report on modules that are not controlled by software, such as blank modules installed in empty slots to control airflow. Note This table provides descriptions of the module status displayed by the show module commands. DescriptionLine Card State The hardware has electrical power. When the hardware is powered up, the software begins booting. powered up The module has established connection with the supervisor and the module is performing bootup diagnostics. testing The diagnostics have completed successfully and the configuration is being downloaded. initializing The switch detects a module failure upon initialization and automatically attempts to power-cycle the module three times. After the third attempt, the module powers down. failure The switch is ready to be configured.ok The switch detects insufficient power for a line card to power up.power-denied This module is the active supervisor or system controller module and the switch is ready to be configured. active The HA switchover mechanism is enabled on the standby supervisor module.HA-standby The switchover mechanism is enabled on the standby system controller module.standby Use the show module [slot_number] command to display information about all of the installed modules or for the module that you specify by its slot number.

Each system controller, supervisor, line card, and fabric module has temperature sensors with two thresholds: • Minor temperature threshold—When a minor threshold is exceeded, a minor alarm occurs and the following actions occur for all four sensors: ◦Displays system messages ◦Sends Call Home alerts (if configured) Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 56 Managing the Switch Displaying Temperatures for a Module ◦Sends SNMP notifications (if configured) • Major temperature threshold—When a major threshold is exceeded, a major alarm occurs and the following actions occur: ◦For sensors 1, 3, and 4 (outlet and onboard sensors), the following actions occur: ◦Displays system messages. ◦Sends Call Home alerts (if configured). ◦Sends SNMP notifications (if configured). ◦For sensor 2 (intake sensor), the following actions occur: ◦If the threshold is exceeded in a switching module, only that module is shut down. ◦If the threshold is exceeded in an active supervisor module with HA-standby or standby present, only that supervisor module is shut down and the standby supervisor module takes over. ◦If you do not have a standby supervisor module in your switch, you have up to 2 minutes to decrease the temperature. During this interval, the software monitors the temperature every 5 seconds and continuously sends system messages as configured. We recommend that you install dual supervisor modules. If you are using a switch without dual supervisor modules, we recommend that you immediately replace the fan module if just one fan is not working. Tip A threshold value of –127 indicates that no thresholds are configured or applicable.Note This command reports on only software-controlled modules, such as supervisors, system controllers, line cards, fabric modules, fan trays, and power supplies. It does not report on modules that are not controlled by software, such as blank modules installed in empty slots to control airflow. Note Use the show environment temperature command to display the temperature readings for each of the powered-up modules. switch# show environment temperature Temperature: -------------------------------------------------------------------- Module Sensor MajorThresh MinorThres CurTemp Status (Celsius) (Celsius) (Celsius) -------------------------------------------------------------------- 4 CPU 105 95 32 Ok 4 TD2-1 105 95 41 Ok 4 TD2-2 105 95 41 Ok 4 TD2-3 105 95 41 Ok 4 VRM-1 110 100 41 Ok 4 VRM-2 110 100 45 Ok 4 VRM-3 110 100 40 Ok 22 CPU 105 95 34 Ok Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 57 Managing the Switch Displaying Temperatures for a Module 22 TD2-1 105 95 45 Ok 22 TD2-2 105 95 41 Ok 22 VRM-1 110 100 49 Ok 22 VRM-2 110 100 47 Ok 27 OUTLET 75 55 29 Ok 27 INLET 60 42 20 Ok 27 CPU 90 80 27 Ok 28 OUTLET 75 55 27 Ok 28 INLET 60 42 22 Ok 28 CPU 90 80 33 Ok 29 CPU 105 95 40 Ok 30 CPU 105 95 34 Ok switch# Connecting to a Module You can connect to any module by using the attach module slot_number command.

Once you enter this command, the running and the startup copies of the configuration are identical. The following table lists various scenarios when module configurations are preserved or lost. ResultScenario The configured module information is lost.A particular switching module is removed and you used the copy running-config startup-config command again. The configured module information is preserved.A particular switching module is removed and the same switching module is replaced before you enter the copy running-config startup-config command again. The configured module information is preserved.A particular switching module is removed and replaced with the same type switching module, and you entered the reload module slot_number command. The configured module information is preserved.A particular switching module is reloaded when you enter the reload module slot_number command. Shutting Down or Starting Up a Module You can shut down or power up a module by using the poweroff module or no poweroff module command to specify the module by its slot number in the chassis. To determine the slot number for a module, use the show inventory command.Note You can use this command with software-controlled modules, such as supervisors, system controllers, line cards, fabric modules, fan trays, and power supplies. It does not work with modules that are not controlled by software, such as blank modules installed in empty slots to control airflow. Note Step 1 Use the configure terminal to enter the global configuration mode. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 59 Managing the Switch Saving the Module Configuration Example: switch# configure terminal switch(config)# Step 2 Shut down (or alternatively power up) a specific module by entering the [no] poweroff module slot_number command. Example: switch(config)# poweroff module 3 switch(config)# Example: switch(config)# no poweroff module 3 switch(config)# Purging a Nonfunctioning Module from the Running Configuration Verify that either the system controller, line card, or fabric slot is empty or that the module installed in the slot is powered down. You can clear the running configuration for a system controller, line card, or fabric slot (slots 1 to 30) that is not functioning by using the purge module command in EXEC mode. This command does not work on supervisor slots or on any line card slot that currently has a powered-up module or on blank modules. Use the purge module slot_number runnning-config command to clear the running configuration for the specified line card slot. Note switch# purge module 4 running-config For example, suppose that you create an IP storage configuration with a line card in slot 3 of Switch A. This module uses an IP address. You decide to remove this line card module and move it to Switch B, and you no longer need the IP address. If you try to configure this unused IP address, you receive an error message that prevents you from proceeding with the configuration. In this case, you need to enter the purge module 3 running-config command to clear the old configuration in Switch A before using the IP address. Displaying Power Usage Information To display the power usage information for the entire switch, use the show environment power command. This command shows the power usage for the power consuming modules installed in the switch. Power usage is reserved for both supervisor modules regardless of whether one or both supervisor modules are present. Note Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 60 Managing the Switch Purging a Nonfunctioning Module from the Running Configuration Use the show environment power command to display power usage information for the switch.

Reloading a module disrupts traffic through the module.Caution Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 61 Managing the Switch Power Cycling a Module To see which slots are filled with modules, use the show inventory command.Note These commands report on only software-controlled modules, such as supervisors, system controllers, line cards, fabric modules, fan trays, and power supplies. They do not report on modules that are not controlled by software, such as blank modules installed in empty slots to control airflow. Note Step 1 Use the configure terminal command to enter the global configuration mode. Example: switch# configure terminal switch(config)# Step 2 Use the reload module slot_number command to specify the slot number of the module to reset. Example: switch(config)# reload module 4 This command will reload module 4. Proceed[y/n]? [n] y reloading module 4 ... switch(config)# Rebooting a Switch You can reboot or reload the switch by using the reload command without any options. If you need to use the reload command, be sure to save the running configuration first by using the copy running-config startup-config command. Note Step 1 Use the configure terminal command to enter the global configuration mode. Example: switch# configure terminal switch(config)# Step 2 Use the copy running-config startup-config command to save the running configuration. Example: switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config Step 3 Use the reload command to reload the switch. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 62 Managing the Switch Rebooting a Switch Example: switch(config)# reload Overview of Supervisor Modules The switch has one or two supervisor modules of the following types: • Supervisor A (N9K-SUP-A) modules with four cores, 4 executable threads, 16 GB of memory, and 64 GB of SSD) • Supervisor A+ (N9K-SUP-A+) with four cores, 8 executable threads, 1.8 GHz, 16 GB of memory, and 64 GB of SSD • Supervisor B (N9K-SUP-B) with six cores, 12 executable threads, 2.2 GHz, 24 GB of memory, and 256 GB of SSD • Supervisor B+ (N9K-SUP-B+) with six cores, 12 executable threads, 1.9 GHz, 32 GB of memory, and 256 GB of SSD When a switch has two supervisors, one supervisor is automatically active while the other is in standby mode. If the active supervisor goes down or is disconnected for replacement, the standby supervisor automatically becomes active. If you need to replace one of two installed supervisor modules with another module, you can do so without interrupting operations. The supervisor that you are not replacing becomes the active supervisor and retains the kickstart configuration while you replace the other supervisor. If the switch has just one supervisor, you can install the new supervisor in the open supervisor slot during operations and make that supervisor active after the installation. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 63 Managing the Switch Overview of Supervisor Modules If there are two supervisors installed in the chassis, both must be the same type or you can mix types as shown in the following table: Table 3: Is Combination Allowed?Standby SupervisorActive Supervisor Note YesSupervisor ASupervisor A YesSupervisor BSupervisor B No--allowed only if Supervisor A can failover to Supervisor B.

When using only five fabric modules, the bandwidth will be up to 92 percent of the maximum bandwidth possible with six fabric modules. 2 When using N9K-X9636C-R and N9K-X9636Q-R line cards, you can get maximum bandwidth when you use five N9K-fabric modules plus one fabric module for redundancy or when you use six fabric modules. The fabric modules must be installed in specific slots as follows (installing fabric modules in other slots can cause a module mismatch condition): • For three modules, they must be in slots FM 2, FM 4, and FM 6. • For four modules, they must be in slots FM 2, FM 3, FM 4, and FM 6. • For five modules, they can be in slots FM 1, FM 2, FM 3, FM 4, and FM 6. Alternatively, they can be in slots FM 2, FM 3, FM 4, FM 5, and FM 6. • For six modules, they will be in slots FM 1, FM 2, FM 3, FM 4, FM 5, and FM 6. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 68 Managing the Switch Overview of Fabric Modules The following table lists which fabric module slots are behind each fan tray. The fan tray has an LED that displays the status for the two fabric modules behind it. To replace a fabric module, you must first remove the fan tray that covers it. Fabric slots FM 2, FM 4, or FM 6 must be filled with functioning fabric modules in order to provide power to the fan trays covering those modules. If fabric slots FM 1, FM 3, or FM 5 are not filled with a fabric module, you must make sure that they have a blank module (N9K-C9508-FM-CV) installed to preserve the designed airflow. Note Fabric Module SlotsFan Tray Slot FM 1 (slot 21 in reports)FAN 1 FM 2 (slot 22 in reports) FM 3 (slot 23 in reports)FAN 2 FM 4 (slot 24 in reports) FM 5 (slot 25 in reports)FAN 3 FM 6 (slot 26 in reports) Overview of Power Modes You can configure one of the following power modes to either use the combined power provided by the installed power supply units (no power redundancy) or to provide power redundancy for when there is a power loss: Combined mode This mode allocates the combined power of all power supplies to active power for switch operations. This mode does not allocate reserve power for power redundancy in case of power outages or power supply failures. n+1 redundancy mode This mode allocates one power supply as a reserve power supply in case an available power supply fails. The remaining power supplies are allocated for available power. The reserve power supply must be at least as powerful as each power supply used for the available power. For example, if a switch requires 2.0 kW of available power and the switch has two power supplies that each output 3 kW, then one of the power supplies provides 3.0 kW of available power and one power supply provides 3.0 kW of reserve power in case the other power supply fails. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 69 Managing the Switch Overview of Power Modes n+n redundancy mode This mode allocates half of the power to available power and the other half to reserve power. You must use a different power source for the active and reserve power sources so that if the power source used for active power fails, the other power source used for the reserve power can provide power for the switch. For example, if the switch requires 4.0 kW of power, the switch has four power supplies that each output 3 kW. If you have two power grids, you use grid A to power two 3-kW power supplies that provide the available power for the switch and you use grid B to power the other two 3-kW power supplies that provide the reserve power in case grid A fails. Power Mode Configuration Guidelines The amounts of available and reserve power depend on the power redundancy mode that you specify and the number of power supplies installed in the switch. For each redundancy mode, consider the following: Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 70 Managing the Switch Power Mode Configuration Guidelines Combined mode The available power equals the combined output of all installed power supplies. There is no reserve power. You activate this mode by using the power redundancy-mode combined command. For example, if the power requirement for a switch is 5.2 kW and the switch has one 3-kW power supply with 220-V input and 3.0-kW output, consider the following power planning scenarios: • Scenario 1—No added power supplies If you do not add a power supply unit, the available power (3.0 kW) is insufficient for the switch power requirement of 5.2 kW, so the switch powers the supervisor modules, system controllers, fan trays, and at least one fabric module before powering as many of the fabric and line cards as the remaining available power can support (one or more fabric or line cards might not be powered). • Scenario 2—Install an extra 3-kW power supply If you install an additional 3-kW power supply unit that can output 3.0 kW, the available power becomes 6.0 kW. The increased amount of available power exceeds the switch power requirement of 5.2 kW, so all of the modules and fan trays in the switch can power up. The following table shows the results for each scenario. ResultReserve Power Available Power Power Supply 2 Output Power Supply 1 Output Power Requirement Scenario Available power is less than the power requirement for the switch, so you cannot power the entire switch (some of the line cards will not be able to power up). —3.0 kW—3.0 kW5.2 kW1 Available power exceeds the power requirement for the switch, so the entire switch can power up. —6.0 kW3.0 kW3.0 kW5.2 kW2 Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 71 Managing the Switch Power Mode Configuration Guidelines n+1 redundancy mode The power supply that outputs the most power provides the reserve power so that it can take over for any other power supply that fails, and all of the other installed power supplies provide the available power. You activate this power mode by using the power redundancy-mode ps-redundant command. For example, if the power requirement for a switch is 5.2 kW and the switch has two 3.0-kW power supplies outputting 3.0 kW each, consider the following power planning scenarios: • Scenario 1—No added power supplies One 3-kW power supply provides the reserve power and the other 3-kW power supply, also outputting 3.0 kW, provides the available power. The available power (3.0 kW) does not meet the switch requirements of 5.2 kW, so the switch powers up except for some of its line cards. • Scenario 2—Adding one 3-kW power supply One 3-kW power supply, which outputs 3.0 kW, provides the reserve power and the other two 3-kW power supplies, also outputting 3.0 kW each, provide a sufficient amount of power (6.0 kW) to meet the switch requirements (5.2 kW), so the entire switch powers up. The following table shows the results for each scenario. ResultReserve Power Available Power Output (kW) for Power Supplies Power Requirement Scenario 321 Available power is less than the power requirement for the switch, so you cannot power the entire switch (one or two of the line cards will not be able to power up). 3.0 kW3.0 kW—3.0 kW3.0 kW5.2 kW1 Available power exceeds the power requirement for the switch, so the entire switch can power up. 3.0 kW6.0 kW3.0 kW3.0 kW3.0 kW5.2 kW2 Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 72 Managing the Switch Power Mode Configuration Guidelines n+n redundancy mode Half of the 3-kW power supplies are connected to one power source (grid) and the other half are connected to another power source. The available power is provided by one power source and the reserve power is provided by the other power source. If the power source that provides the available power fails, the switch uses the reserve power source to provide its required power. You activate this power mode by using the power redundancy-mode insrc_redundant command. For example, if the power requirement for a switch is 5.2 kW and the switch has two power supplies that output 3 kW, consider the following power planning scenarios: • Scenario 1—No added power supplies The available power is 3.0 kW (output from one 3-kW power supply) and the reserve power is 3.0 kW (output from the other power supply). The available power (3.0 kW) does not meet the switch requirements (5.2 kW), so most of the modules will power up but some of the line cards will not be able to power up. • Scenario 2—Adding two 3-kW power supplies The available power is 6.0 kW (output from two 3-kW power supplies on grid A) and the reserve power is 6.0 kW (output from the other two power supplies on grid B). The available power (6.0 kW) exceeds the power requirement of the switch (5.2 kW), so the entire switch can power up. The following table shows the results for each scenario. ResultReserve Power Available Power Output for Power SuppliesPower Requirement Scenario 4321 Available power (3.0 kW) is less than the power requirement for the switch (5.2 kW)—switch powers up but some of the line cards cannot power up. 3.0 kW3.0 kW——3.0 kW3.0 kW5.2 kW1 Available power (6.0 kW) exceeds the power requirement for the switch (5.2 kW)—entire switch powers up. 6.0 kW6.0 kW3.0 kW3.0 kW3.0 kW3.0 kW5.2 kW2 For grid redundancy mode, the power supplies must be divided into two equal sets and installed as follows: • Slots labeled as PS 1 to PS 4 must be connected to one grid (Grid A) • Slots labeled as PS 5 to PS 8 must be connected to another grid (Grid B) Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 73 Managing the Switch Power Mode Configuration Guidelines Setting the Power Mode You can configure the power supply mode by using the power redundancy-mode command. To display the current power supply configuration, use the show environment power command.Note Before You Begin For grid redundancy mode, the power supplies must be divided into two equal sets and installed as follows: • Slots PS 1 to PS 4 must be connected to one grid (Grid A) • Slots PS 5 to PS 8 must be connected to another grid (Grid B) Step 1 Use the configure terminal command to enter the global configuration mode. Example: switch# configure terminal switch(config)# Step 2 Use the power redundancy-mode mode command to specify one of the following power modes: • For combined mode, include the combined keyword. • For n+1 redundancy mode, include the ps-redundant keyword. • For n+n redundancy mode, include the insrc_redundant keyword. Example: switch(config)# power redundancy-mode insrc_redundant switch(config)# Overview of Fan Trays Fan trays provide airflow through the switch for cooling. Each fan tray contains multiple fans to provide redundancy. The switch can continue functioning in the following situations: • One or more fans fail within a fan tray—Even with multiple fan failures, the switch can continue functioning. When a fan fails within a tray, the functioning fans in the module increase their speed to compensate for the failed fans. • The fan tray is removed for replacement—The fan tray is designed to be removed and replaced while the switch is operating without presenting an electrical hazard or damage to the switch. The switch can operate for three minutes without the fan tray that you are replacing, but if the switch air-inlet temperature is less than 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), you have up to 72 hours to replace the fan tray. Cisco Nexus 9508 NX-OS Mode Switch Hardware Installation Guide 74 Managing the Switch Setting the Power Mode Because temperatures can change over time, we recommend that you replace the fan tray within three minutes. • If you remove more than one fan tray at a time, the switch can operate up to three minutes before shutting down. To prevent a shutdown, remove only one fan tray at a time. When a fan fails or when you remove a fan tray, the remaining operating fans speed up to compensate for the loss of fans. This process can increase the noise made by the fan trays until you replace the missing fan tray or replace the defective fan tray. Note When replacing a failed fan tray in a running system, be sure to promptly replace the fan tray.Note If one or more fans fail within a fan tray, the Fan Status LED turns red. A fan failure could lead to temperature alarms if not corrected immediately. Tip The fan status is continuously monitored by the software. In case of a fan failure, the following actions occur: • System messages are displayed. • Call Home alerts are sent (if configured). • SNMP notifications are sent (if configured). To display the fan module statuses, see Displaying the Status for the Fan Trays, on page 75.

Replacing a Fan Tray You can remove a fan tray to either replace it with another fan tray or to replace a fabric module located behind it. The switch uses three fan trays but it can operate with two fan trays while you replace one or remove one to replace one of the fabric modules behind the fan tray. When you remove one fan tray, the other fan trays speed up their fans to maintain the designed airflow. If you cannot replace a fan tray within three minutes, we recommend that you leave it in the chassis until you are ready to replace it. Note If you remove more than one fan tray at a time during operations, the switch allows up to two minutes of operations before shutting down unless you replace extra missing fan trays within that time. If the switch senses an over-temperature condition when multiple fan trays are removed, the shutdown can occur in less than two minutes. Note Statement 1034—Backplane Voltage Hazardous voltage or energy is present on the backplane when the system is operating. Use caution when servicing. Warning Removing a Fan Tray Remove only one fan tray at a time during switch operations. If you remove more than one fan tray at a time, the switch will shut down within two minutes unless you replace the extra fan trays that you removed within that time. Before You Begin • You must wear an electrostatic discharge (ESD) wrist strap or other ESD protective device while handling modules. • Prepare an antistatic surface or packing materials for each module that you remove from the chassis. Step 1 Open the packaging for the new fan tray and inspect it for damage.

Alternatively, they can be in slots FM2, FM3, FM4, FM5, and FM6. • For six modules, they will be in slots FM 1, FM 2, FM 3, FM 4, FM 5, and FM 6. Fabric slots FM 2, FM 4, or FM 6 must be filled with functioning fabric modules or blank modules with power connectors (N9K-C9508-FM-Z) in order to provide power to the fan trays covering those modules. If fabric slots FM 1, FM 3, or FM 5 are not filled with a fabric module, you must make sure that they have a blank module (N9K-C9508-FM-CV) installed to preserve the designed airflow. Note You can replace a fabric module while other fabric modules are operating by removing the fan tray in front of the fabric module, removing the fabric module, installing the new fabric module, and replacing the fan tray over the installed fabric module. To maintain the designed airflow while you remove the fan tray, the fans in the other fan trays increase their speed. During operations, we recommend that you remove only one fan tray at a time and reinstall that fan tray within three minutes to avoid the possibility of having the switch overheat and shut down. If you remove more than one fan tray at a time, the switch will shut down if you do not reinstall the extra missing fan trays within two minutes (the shutdown can occur earlier if the switch over heats).

Installing or Replacing Power Supplies The number of 3-kW power supplies that you install depends on the power requirements of the switch and the power mode that you are using. To determine the power requirements of the switch, see the Power Requirements for Switch Modules section. If you are using only one power source for the combined mode or n+1 redundancy mode, you can install the power supplies in any of the power supply slots on the chassis. If you are using two power sources for the n+n redundancy mode, you must connect the power supplies in slots 1 through 4 to one power source and the power supplies in slots 5 through 8 to the other power source. With n+n redundancy mode, divide the power supplies evenly between the first half of the slots and the last half of the slots so that the amount of redundant power for the switch equals the amount of available power for the switch. Statement 1034—Backplane Voltage Hazardous voltage or energy is present on the backplane when the system is operating. Use caution when servicing. Warning Statement 1029—Blank Faceplates and Cover Panels Blank faceplates and cover panels serve three important functions: they prevent exposure to hazardous voltages and currents inside the chassis; they contain electromagnetic interference (EMI) that might disrupt other equipment; and they direct the flow of cooling air through the chassis. Do not operate the system unless all cards, faceplates, front covers, and rear covers are in place. Warning You can install or replace any of the following Cisco Nexus 9500 Series power supplies in this switch so long as all of the power supplies use the same type of power (not a mix of AC and DC power): • 3-kW AC Power Supply • 3-kW Universal AC/DC Power Supply • 3-kW DC Power Supply These power supplies are interchangeable so long as all of the power supplies in the same switch use AC or DC input power (not a mix of AC and DC power sources).

Power Requirements for Switch Modules To determine the number of power supplies required to operate all the modules in a switch, add together the maximum power amounts for each module in the switch, divide the sum by 3000 W, and if there is a fractional amount in the result, add 1 to the result. For n+1 redundancy, add one more power supply. For n+n redundancy, double the number of power supplies and provision for a second power source. To determine the typical consumption, add together the typical power amounts for each module in the switch. If you order new power supplies, make sure that the new power supplies use the same type of power (AC or DC) as the rest of the power supplies in the same switch. Do not use a mix of AC and DC power sources for a switch.
