This will not work with any other resolution. Download LED Toolbox 1.4 from this link: https://nbcuni-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/206082017_tfayd_com/Documents/NBC%20Production%20Engineering%20Studios%20Support/Leyard%20LED%20Software/LED_ToolBox_1.4.0.0%5B1%5D.exe?csf=1&web=1&e=jumnEu Install LED Toolbox on Windows laptop. Set laptop ethernet port to 192.168.0.55 with subnet mase 255.255.255.0 (no gateway needed). Plug ethernet into TV Player. Run LED Toolbox; set IP address of TV player and confirm it pings successfully by hitting the P button next to IP: Under Cabinate Type make sure TVH and TVH1.6 are selected. Hit Broadcast Address. On the top menu select 50 PLAYER and then choose LED Control (50 PLAYER). On the big config page that comes up, you will be modifying the rows and columns section and the X and Y coorinates section. First for the rows and columns, choose how many horiztonal rows and vertical columns of tiles you have connected via LVDS signal cables from this one TV player (ie in the example below the TV player has 1 row and 3 columns). Enter those details in the rows and columns section and hit Set. Next in the top right area go to Output Coordinates and enter in any X and Y offsets based on the number of tiles. Each TVH 1.67 LED cabinet is 240x180. For instance, if the tiles are the top left section of a 1920x1080 signal, you would enter 0 for X and 0 for Y. If the tiles are the next three tiles over in the same signal, it would be 720 for X and 0 for Y. In this section, X represents how many pixels from left of image the tiles are showing and Y represents how many pixels from top of image the tiles are showing. The X and Y coordinates are always for the top-most and left-most tile in the arrangement. In the example below, itâ€™s a 2-row, 2-column tile setup and we are looking at the right-most part of an HD image. So our X is 1440 and our Y is 0. Once set all these settings will persist in the TV Player until changed again.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
