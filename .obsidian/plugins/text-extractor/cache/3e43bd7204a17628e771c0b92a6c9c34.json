The CA-76 board contains the CPU module (CPU-DT) board. The CPU module board is the center of these operations and establishes the communication with the equipment connected to the CTRL LAN, PERIPH LAN, SBUS and EDITOR ports in synchronism with the externally input REF VIDEO signal. It also establishes control of the device on the control panel. The built-in CPU of the FPGA (IC1000) mounted on board realizes the CTRL LAN and PERIPH LAN communications via Ethernet. The FPGA (IC1800) controls the switches, LEDs, and LCD monitors of the panel that are connected to the MAIN PANEL, MENU PANEL, and EXT PANEL terminals. PLD (IC701) controls the display for the display components mounted in front of the CA-76 board and on the device on the control panel. IC4201, IC4401, and IC5201 are main CPUs used for controlling the GUI. They include functions to control the touch panel (RS-232C) and buzzer, and functions to display the USB, DATA LAN, External Menu Panel, and External Display screens. The GUI application starts up from the compact flash card on the board. Data such as the data for frame memory and all types of setup data are saved on the HDD on the board. The DC-DC converter on the CA-76 board generates the power supply voltages +5 V, +3.3 V and +1.5 V used in the CA-76 board, and the ATX power supply voltages 5 V_ATX and 3.3 V_ATX.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
