If a portion of the device screen is still unresponsive, click Calibrate and follow the directions on screen. Calibration should be done separately for both pen and touch using a PPI by Microsoft Active Stylus and a finger. For best results, touch the center of each box until each box becomes bright green. You may need to shift your fingertip or stylus slightly to get the crosshair to align with the box. Also, you must wait until the crosshair changes size for a second and then changes color, preferably bright green. If a box turns red, brown, or a dull green you should move on to other boxes and then come back to it to make it bright green. You will have calibrated the device properly when all of the boxes are bright green and the feedback text reads 9 points calibrated, with excellent accuracy. ©2013 Microsoft Corporation 17 6.
