Why now? ▪ Challenges Where We Are Company Confidential ▪ Standard Ethernet or 10Base-T operates over twisted pair Cat 5 or Cat 6 cable. ▪ The twist prevents crosstalk and RF Interference between the pairs. ▪ Provides basic transmission rates for half-duplex and full duplex networks Standard Ethernet (10Mb) Company Confidential ▪ Taking over for LAN standard. ▪ Delivers one billion bits per second ▪ Carried over optical fiber mostly or short-haul copper ▪ 10/100Mb cards can be carried on this standard ▪ Support half or full-duplex Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) Company Confidential ▪ Supports only full-duplex links ▪ CSMA/CD is not supported (carrier sense multiple access with collision detection) ▪ This is a disruptive technology that displaced previous tech. It offers faster, more efficient and less expensive data handling ▪ Uses optical fiber for LANs, WANs and MANs 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GbE) Company Confidential ▪ An optical fiber is a long thin strand of impurity-free glass used as a transport medium for data. ▪ A typical point-to-point fiber optic communication network consists of a transmitter (laser), a transport medium (optical fiber) and a receiver (photo-diode) ▪ Evertz products use 10 Gigabit Ethernet optical interfaces as defined by IEEE 802.3ae Fiber Company Confidential ▪ Optical signals over fiber travel much farther than electrical signals over copper • A few hundred meters vs 100+km ▪ Not susceptible to electrical interference ▪ Fiber is similar cost or cheaper than copper ▪ Can get many more signals don to a single fiber than a copper cable using TDM/WDM technology ▪ Secure monitoring of optical power Why Use Fiber Optics? Company Confidential ▪ Core • Contains optical power • High refractive index (1.48) ▪ Cladding • Surrounds the core and creates a wave guide effect confining optical power to core • Lower refractive index (1.46) ▪ Buffer • Protective plastic/acrylic layer ▪ Strength Member • Surrounds the Buffer and protects again damage from tension on the fiber ▪ Outer Jacket • Polymer/plastic to protect against environmental damage What is Fiber? Company Confidential ▪ There are 2 key considerations when moving signals over FIBER • 1 – Dispersion • Different wavelengths travel at different speeds over fiber • A pulse of light spreads as it travels through an optical fiber eventually overlapping the neighboring pulse • Narrow light sources yield less dispersion • 2 – Attenuation • Attenuation is the reduction in signal strength or light power over the length of the light carrying medium • This is how distances are calculated • 1310=0.35dB/Km • 1550=0.25dB/Km Considerations Company Confidential ▪ Multimode • Has a large core which allows the light to reflect inside • After bouncing around inside the fiber not all of the light arrives at the end at the same time it entered • Not good for long distances especially high bandwidth solutions ▪ Single Mode • Has a very thin core which directs the light in a straight line Types of Fiber Company Confidential ▪ Single Mode • 9micromillimeter core/125micrometer cladding • Only one ray allowed to enter the fiber • Used for high bandwidths & lang haul systems • Compatible with WDM technology • YELLOW JACKET ▪ Multi Mode • 50/62.5micrometer core/125micrometer cladding • Allows multiple rays to propagate down the fiber • Used for low bandwidth & short haul systems • ORANGE JACKET Types of Fiber Company Confidential ▪ Optical fiber has many advantages over traditional copper cable and free-space microwave networks: • Less signal degradation per meter • Higher signal carrying capacity / bandwidth • Less costly per meter • Lighter and thinner than copper wire • Free from electromagnetic interference (Poor weather does not affect signal) • Lower transmitter launching power • Flexible (used in medical and mechanical imaging systems) Advantages of Fiber Company Confidential ▪ A properly functioning fiber optic network requires clinical cleanliness of all fiber optic connections. ▪ A single particle of dust or fingerprint can scatter enough optical power from the core to take down an entire link. ▪ While not in use all fiber connector tips should be covered with dust caps to prevent damage such as scratches and pits from forming on the connector ends. ▪ Pits and scratches on the surface of a connector can migrate when mated to another connector. ▪ To avoid damaging fiber connectors Evertz recommends cleaning both ends of the fiber connection prior to mating using a Cletop Reel Care for Fibers Company Confidential ▪ Avoid the following: • Stretching or pulling beyond manufacturer’s specifications • Creating tension in a cable run • Crushing with copper cables in a cable run • Plastic tie-wraps where the tie wrap too tightly squeezes fiber • Creating a bend beyond a 5cm bending radius ▪ Clean vs Dirty Fiber endface, don’t touch the endface of the fiber Care for Fibers Company Confidential ▪ The following are recommendations on best cleaning tools: • Fluke Solvent Pen + Cube for the most effective end face cleaning • Cletop Cassette Cleaner for an effective and quick way to clean end faces • Seikoh Giken SFM-125/250 for an effective and quick way to clean end faces within an adapter Cleaning Tools Company Confidential ▪ SFP’s are designed for optical communication between equipment and devices. ▪ They come in a range of bandwidths: 1Gb/s, 10Gb/s, 25Gb/s, 40Gb/s and 100Gb/s ▪ In addition to bandwidth restrictions, SFP’s can also be purchased based on Wavelength requirements and Distance ▪ Evertz offers: MM (multimode) 850nm and SM (singlemode) 1310nm as standard • In addition for longer reach applications Evertz offers 1550nm SFP’s Company Confidential SFP’s SFP Model Wavelength Optical Output Power Receiver Sensitivity Receiver Max Input Nominal Received Wavelength Max Distance MAX MIN SFP10G-TR85-A 850nm -1dBm -6.5dBm -11dBm -1dBm 850nm 300m SFP10G-TR13-A 1310nm +0.5dBm -8.5dBm -12dBm 0dBm 1310nm 10km SFP10G-TR15S 1550nm +4dBm -5dBm -15dBm 0dBm 1270-1610nm 40km SFP10G-TR15H 1550nm +3dBm 0dBm -24dBm -7dBm 1270-1610nm 80km ▪ The SFP10G-TR series is a convenient hot-swappable form factor that allows for easy selection and future addition or reconfiguration of SFP’s and wavelengths while maintaining the same base hardware. ▪ The Evertz SFP10G-TR series may be installed in any Evertz equipment that specifies an Evertz SFP10G-TR SFP. Company Confidential ▪ These are messages that are sent from one device to another device; they are not intended for others. ▪ Addressing a message to a particular computer doesn’t guarantee that others won’t also read it; it’s just that they normally will not do so. Unicast Messages Company Confidential ▪ As the name suggests, these messages are sent to every device on a network. ▪ You use them when you need to communicate a piece of information to everyone on the network, or when the sending station needs to send it to just one recipient, but doesn’t know its address. Broadcast Messages Company Confidential ▪ These are a compromise between the previous two types. ▪ Multicast messages are sent to a group of stations that meet a particular set of criteria. ▪ These stations are usually related to each other in some way. For example, they serve a common function or are set up into a particular multicast group. Multicast Messages Company Confidential ▪ Why do we use multicast? • Unicast messages are sent from one device to another device; they are not intended for others • Have to send multiple of these to send the same message to specific devices • Takes a significant amount of bandwidth • Multicast messages make it easy to send multiple parties the same information simultaneously • By doing this there is significant bandwidth savings Unicast vs. Multicast Company Confidential ▪ Information that is placed before the actual data. The header normally contains a small number of control- information bytes, which are used to communicate important facts about the data that the message contains and how it is to be interpreted and used. It serves as the communication and control link between protocol elements on different devices. Header Company Confidential ▪ The actual data to be transmitted, often called the payload of the message Data Company Confidential Transport of High Bit Rate Media Signals over IP Networks (HBRMT) ▪ Used only for Uncompressed Video transport ▪ Defines a unidirectional IP-based protocol for the transport of real-time video, audio and ancillary signals ▪ Particularly, the standard defines a method or encapsulation for the payloads of existing SD video signals ▪ This standard pertains to uncompressed signals with rates of 270Bbits/s or higher.
