Here we are using the PRE/POST Attach Buttons NORM/REV and PATT LIMIT button substitutions are on Menu Page 7321.9 71 Multi-Program 2 Assign Keyers to Main/Sub Sides (1) Assign Keyers in the PGM CONFIG Menu The Default State when Splitting an M/E is that Keyers 1-4 are assigned to the MAIN Side and Keyers 5-8 are assigned to the SUB Side.\t \r You can Modify this if you wish Note that the M/E’s PGM 1 is the MAIN SIDE and consists of CLEAN (A&B Buses) with Keyers. PGM 2 is the SUB SIDE and consists of SUB CLEAN with Keyers.\t \r PGM 1 appears on the M/E’s Output 1 while PGM 2 appears on the M/E’s Output 6 72 Multi-Program 2 Assign Keyers to Main/Sub Sides (2) The 6 Outputs of Each M/E Here we see M/E 1’s 6 Outputs...\t \r Output 1 is the M/E’s PGM 1 (Main) Output 2 is the Main’s Preview Output 6 is the M/E’s PGM 2 (Sub) Output 5 is the Sub Preview Outputs 3 & 4 are defaulted to PGM 3 and Key Preview 1, but they can be changed to whatever you want.\t \r In Fact, Outputs 2-5 are programmable and can be changed to any combination of PROGRAM or Key Preview Outputs. 73 Multi-Program 2 What is a Program Output? • Each M/E has up to 4 PROGRAM OUTPUTS\t \r • The Background of each PGM can be A/B, U2/U3, Just A or B, Just U2 or U3\t \r • There are restrictions on which buses can be used for Backgrounds on each PGM Output \t \r • Each PGM Output can have from 0-8 Keyers over its Background\t \r • As the User Turns Assigned Keyers On & Off, they go ON & Off on the PGM Outputs \t \r • Key 1 cannot be used on the PGM 2 Output - This is an Artiﬁcial Software Limitation \t \r • Each M/E has up to 2 KEY PREVIEW OUTPUTS\t \r • The Background of each K-PVW can be A/B or U2/U3\t \r • K-PVWs can Output either a Video Signal or a Key Signal\t \r • Any Keyer can be put onto either K-PVW\t \r • Keyers can either follow the User, be Always On or Always Off 74 Multi-Program 2 Is MP2 Free Re-Entry Necessary? Activating Free Re-Entry will cause a 1-line Shift on the M/E! If an M/E can be re-entered into itself, one could create on PGM 1 (MAIN) a background with a DVE box being fed by PGM 2\t \r The User could thus transition inside of the box by transitioning on the SUB Side of the same M/E If the PGM 2 Output of the M/E is being used to feed a Monitor on Stage or is being used as another unique M/E in the switcher then Free Re- Entry is not needed 75 Multi-Program 2 Should MP2 be recalled at the M/E Level? Not Knowing Which Mode MP2 is in can Bite You! Turning this ON will cause the M/E Mode to change based on Snapshot and/ or Timeline Effects.\t \r This could be desirable if the User sometimes uses MP2 but does not need MP2 throughout the entire Show If the User is ALWAYS going to be using MP2 is is NEVER going to use MP2, then leaving this button OFF causes the M/E Mode to remain as an unchanging (and thus predictable) Engineering Setting. 76 Multi-Program 2 Splitting the M/E’s Memory (1) • When MP2 is Activated, the Normal Memory of the M/E (Snapshots, Timeline Effects, etc.) is Split into a Main & Sub Side\t \r • Each Side of the M/E has its own set of Snapshots & Timelines\t \r • This can cause problems in case one keyer is assigned to BOTH the Main & Sub Sides - in this case, the LAST side to recall information about that keyer “wins”\t \r • In order to use this Split Memory, you MUST Map the Main & Sub Sides into accessible Regions 77 Multi-Program 2 Splitting the M/E’s Memory (2) When you are Storing a Snapshot into an M/E’s Flexipad:\t \r - If MAIN is Selected, then you are Storing ONLY the Main Side of the M/E into a register on the Flexipad\t \r - If SUB is Selected, then you are Storing ONLY the SUB Side of the M/E into a register on the Flexipad\t \r Thus Register #10 on the Sub Side holds different information than Register #10 on the Main Side\t \r - If MAIN and SUB are Selected, then you are Storing both the MAIN & SUB Side of the M/E into a register on the Flexipad\t \r Thus even though Register #10 on the Sub Side technically holds different information than Register #10 on the Main Side, the two sides of Register #10 are stored at the same time\t \r In the same way that storing both M/E’s 1 & 2 at the same time actually stores different information into the same Register number, so too is it with the MAIN & SUB Sides - you can think of them as 2 separate M/E’s 78 Multi-Program 2 Assigning Main & Sub Sides to Regions (1) Each Region Button has its own M/E Assignment Here we have assigned ME Mains and Me Subs to separate Levels\t \r This provides the greatest operational ﬂexibility but we run out of assignable Regions VERY quickly! 79 Multi-Program 2 Assigning Main & Sub Sides to Regions (2) You can assign up to 4 Regions into each Panel Button Here we have taken advantage of the fact that we can assign up to 4 items into each Region Button\t \r This means that each M/E button contains BOTH the MAIN & SUB Regions This means that we have assigned Regions more Effectively, but it also means that we need to pay attention to our Timeline Menu when building Effects on an M/E! 80 Multi-Program 2 Assigning Main & Sub Sides to Regions (3) In the Timeline Menu, Look for THIS Button 81 Multi-Program 2 Assigning Main & Sub Sides to Regions (4) M/E\t \r 1 M/E 1\t \r MAIN M/E 1\t \r SUB M/E 1\t \r MAIN M/E 1\t \r SUB The Reference Region is the Region that will be displayed on the panel button as the MASTER Region for Keyframe Editing Purposes\t \r Only One Region is used as the Reference The Region Select is the Actual Region that you are Editing. Thus an INSERT or MODIFY will only Affect a Region if it is Activated Here M/E\t \r 1 82 Frame Memory Changes & Enhancements You now have 16 Outputs Rather than 8\t \r Animations vs.Clips\t \r Creating Animations\t \r Creating Clips\t \r Using Ancillary Data to Store & Replay Audio on Clips\t \r - Turning On Ancillary Data & Using the Through Mode\t \r Using Clips as Frame Memory Transitions - Clip Transition Setup\t \r Using Folders to Organize your Data\t \r Backing Up / Restoring to a Firewire Drive\t \r Backing Up / Restoring to a DDR/VTR 83 Multi-Program 2 Tips and Tricks Transitioning inside 1 OTS box - on one M/E\t \r Transitioning inside 2 OTS boxes - on one M/E\t \r Transitioning inside 3 OTS boxes - on one M/E\t \r Transitioning inside 4 OTS boxes - on one M/E\t \r Transitioning inside 4 OTS boxes & the Bkgd - one one M/E\t \r Pre-Treating OTS Boxes with Graphic Edging\t \r Sliding OTS boxes on & off screen - on one M/E 84 SONY 8000X Training Bob Ennis\t \r June 20th thru July 3rd, 2014 85","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
