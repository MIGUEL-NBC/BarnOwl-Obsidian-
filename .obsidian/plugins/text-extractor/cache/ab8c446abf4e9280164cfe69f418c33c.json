{"path":"PDF Library/Graphic Maintenance Quick Reference/Viz One/General Viz One Information.docx","text":"Viz One handles clips for the Viz System. Clips are dropped in via the smbimp folder. Once dropped, you can see the status of the transfer from the Dashboard. Once a clip is in the Viz One system, it is accessible from the Media tab in Viz Pilot. It is then dropped into an iNews rundown by a producer/coordinator, and Viz One will send it to the appropriate engines. You can see this by clicking the clip you want to view from Items in the Dashboard. If the clip is not moving to the engines after being put into a rundown, escalate.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
