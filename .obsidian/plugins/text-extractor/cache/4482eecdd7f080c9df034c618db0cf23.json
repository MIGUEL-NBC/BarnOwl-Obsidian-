Pictured above are: CAT 6 (2412), Flush Cutters, & Ring Tool. STEP 2 Take Cat 6 cable in hand allowing for an inch or two that will be stripped free of the outer jacket. STEP 3 Using the ring tool make contact with the outer jacket of the cable by inserting cable into opening with blade. STEP 4 Rotate ring tool forwards keeping the blade in contact with the outer jacket of the cable. STEP 5 Cut cable strain relief with flush cutters. STEP 6 Separate pairs so that you can easily untwist and place in correct color code STEP 7 Continue untwist. STEP 8 The wires are easier to manipulate when properly separated. STEP 9 Once separated straighten cables using back of ring tool. STEP 10 In most cases TIA-568 (B) color code will be used. White/Orange, Orange, White/Green, Blue, White/Blue, Green, White/Brown, Brown. STEP 11 Double check color code and carefully place RJ-45 connector on. The copper conductor should be facing you & the tab should be away from you. STEP 12 Carefully slide connector onto cable making sure each wire stays straight. The arrow is pointing out the crimp tab. Make sure crimp tab is on outer jacket. STEP 13 Once the connector is properly on you are ready to crimp. STEP 14 Make sure connector is fully seated inside crimper. STEP 15 Top View of Crimp. STEP 16 (A) Verify your crimp. Give a gentle tug to the connector and make sure there aren’t any “shiners” or exposed copper on your wire. STEP 16 (B) Double check your work. Make sure the crimp is on the outer jacket of the cable. The same method applies to plenum (2413) cable as well. STEP 17 Finally, TEST to verify success!","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
