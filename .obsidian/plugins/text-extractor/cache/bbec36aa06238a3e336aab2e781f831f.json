The application is running locally on the PC, which is connected via HDMI to a Decimator MD-HX HDMI- SDI Cross-Converter which then converts the feed to SDI, which hits the router and is color corrected, then routed back and down-converted to the touchscreen. The interactive should run on the B side (feed coming from the router), but you can access the PC desktop directly if needed, using the A side (connected via mini-display port). See the “decimator settings for NUC PC pdf document for troubleshooting the decimator.” A GFX Maintenance Account has been created with the credentials: Username: BMGGFXMaintenance@nbcuni.com Password: Sw0rdphish Note that Projects are unique to every user, so you will not see any projects in this account (unless you create one), producers have their own set of proejcts/hits per account. Outputs, however, are global Producers create content using the Videoflow Producer Tool, and the Elections App is overlaid into Videoflow. Producers can create Hits (called “Projects” in Videoflow) which are made up of Pages. Pages are like slides in a slideshow; you can swipe to move between them. Pages can have content which is either an integration of the Interactive Elections App or browse for an image to display.

Here you will see outputs (global across all accounts) like “4E Production Center,” “4E Town Square,” “Studio 3A,” etc. Outputs are simply unique URLs that can be opened on a studio’s touchscreen PC where content can be loaded to (and seen without logging in). These outputs are the shortcuts that should be on each of the studio’s PC desktop (labeled Interactive App with a black VF). **If there is NOT an Interactive App shortcut on the desktop, you can log into http://videoflow.tfayd.com and go to Outputs, then click “Open in a new tab” **Once the tab is loaded, you can make a shortcut and add the property “--start-fullscreen” to the end of the Target property (make sure all other Chrome instances are closed before launching the shortcut as fullscreen) In the event it has to be loaded quickly, just open the page and make it fullscreen rather than going through the process of creating a shortcut **Troubleshooting: if the output does not load a project, make sure both the PROJECT and OUTPUT are “LIVE” Once the Output is loaded on the desktop and put into fullscreen: If you see a WHITE page, this means that the producer needs to load a hit into the output If you see an ERROR page (Private/Doesn’t Exist) like the following: This means that either the PROJECT or the OUTPUT is not LIVE and the “GO LIVE” button must be pressed:","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
