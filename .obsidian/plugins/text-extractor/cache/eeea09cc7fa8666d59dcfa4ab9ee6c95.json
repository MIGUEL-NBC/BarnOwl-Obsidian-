Locate the new replacement card. Note: New dante cards usually contain the last 4 characters of the mac address in the name i.e. BKLNII-7djh. The card can also be identified by disconnecting it from the switch port and seeing which card disappears in Dante Controller. 4) Rename the replacement card to match the previous name by double-clicking on it in Dante Controller and selecting the “Device Config” tab Note: If the name of the card that needs to be replaced was unknown, you can locate a failed route (has an orange symbol next to it) to determine the original name. In the picture below, the Wohler is unable to receive audio from CR8H-PRISM-A-1. 5) The last step is to restore channel names and routes to/from the new card. Select File -> Load Preset. Every Dante Controller instance in RDM has the Q drive mounted containing saved presets. 6) Select the XML that matches the EPG number and purpose and select “Open.” The EPG number can be confirmed by looking at the hostname of the dante controller machine. In the picture below the hostname is DNT1-C194-4D1K. The EPG # is listed after the letter C on every Dante Controller instance. 7) The old/missing device will be listed in the “Devices in the preset” column. The new replacement card will be listed in the \"Devices on the network” column. 8) The preset menu will automatically match the old device with the new device because they have the same name. Confirm this and select “Apply Role.” Select “Ok” and you are done! Here is an doc from the Audinate website that reviews applying a preset in greater detail: https://dev.audinate.com/GA/dante-controller/userguide/webhelp/content/applying_presets.htm","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
