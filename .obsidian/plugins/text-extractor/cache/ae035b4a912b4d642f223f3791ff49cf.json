{"path":"Referenced Material/Reference Library/Vendor/Neutrik/opticamSWITCH Software Installation.docx","text":"To use the opticamSWITCH® software with your opticamSWITCH®, please follow these steps.  Note that these steps assume that you are using Windows. Unzip the files. Connect your PC to the opticamSWITCH® via a Network Cable If you are using AVG anti-virus, disable it.  (Our experience with other anti-virus programs is that they are fine.  However, if your computer slows down dramatically while using this software, this may be a sign that you will need to disable whatever anti-virus software you are using.) Double-click Opticam.exe.  Again, if any dialog boxes pop up, choose to “allow” or “run” the program. If you are prompted to point to a particular folder then choose the Config folder that is the opticamSWITCH folder. Click the “people” icon at the lower right.  For user “Admin”, enter the password “password” and click “Login.” Now, things are running.  Double-click the block(s) of camera positions on the top and double-click the block(s) of CCUs on the bottom in order to be able to route them.  Double-click them again to make them small.  Only in the “big” state can you perform routing. Now, it’s time to play with the routing. Click and drag down from one camera position to one CCU (i.e. from vertical rectangle to vertical rectangle) in order to route it.  Likewise you can click and drag up from a CCU to a camera position.  Use the smaller red “x” at any one given connection in order to terminate that connection, or use the larger red “x” in a camera block or a CCU block to terminate all of those connections from/to that block at once. Click and drag from the title text of one block down or up to another block.  This will route everything available for that block. After you’ve played around with this, Neutrik can provide different files with different camera and CCU names and different preset routings for the various blocks.  Neutrik can also set up different users with different access to certain blocks.  So, perhaps the user “Allen” is only granted access to camera block 1 and CCU block 6, while “Bob” only has access to camera blocks 3 and 4 and CCU blocks 2 and 7. Think about what’s happening here:  safe routing with no risky manual patching, no need for cleaning—no need for any manual interventions at all.  Remember too that all of this can be placed under control automation so that a pre-set routing can be accomplished at the push of a button by a third-party program (not provided by Neutrik).  Routings are stored in opticamSWITCH’s firmware, so a network failure would not affect the current routing. Hover over the icon(s) for the opticamSWITCH(es) at the lower left.  Note that these icons provide information on the switch, the current routing, and the power conditions of the cameras.  opticamSWITCH will block any routings if the power conditions would be too much for the device to switch safely.  In this case, manually power down the camera from the CCU or at the camera itself, perform the switch, and then power up the camera again. Routing can also easily be done by pressing the physical buttons on opticamSWITCH as well.  To create a route, press a camera button and a CCU button.  To clear a route, hold down an active button; the corresponding patch will flash.  Press and hold that flashing button and the route will be cleared.
