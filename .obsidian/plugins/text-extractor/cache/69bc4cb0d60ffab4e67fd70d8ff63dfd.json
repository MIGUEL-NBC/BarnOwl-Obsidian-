MMA-10G ulizes a highly reliable 10GE/100GE infrastructure for roung video and audio and oﬀers unprecedented scalability and reliability. Standalone 10GE Transceiver The MMA10G-TRXS standalone 10GE transceiver gateway is a single device that can either be used as a receiver or a transmier or both at the same me. Due to the bi-direconal nature of 10GE the TRXS can be used to both send and receive HDMI, SDI, audio + data. Reduce decision making at design me, simply add up number of devices either send or receive and the MMA10G-TRXS can be used for any connecon point. The dual 10GE ports of the TRXS can be used to daisy chain more than one device together saving ports on the switch fabric. HDCP, EDID and Scaling The MMA10G-TRXS ulizes high quality scaling engines which allow it to process and scale video to match any input or output resoluon. Through it’s support for EDID, the TRXS will display the content correctly by seng and reading EDID tables to ensure the smoothest handoﬀ between devices. The TRXS supports HDCP and therefore can send and receive content protected images without compromising rights management. Reliable AV Transport Using 10Gbps Ethernet the MMA10G-TRXS both encapsulates and de-encapsulates video and audio at the same me. TRXS has two HDMI ports, a receive and transmit and supports resoluons up to 1920x1200/60. TRXS supports both embedded audio on HDMI as well as a discrete audio input. A USB connecon is provided to supply HID device connecvity over the MMA-10G network. No compression is used, therefore the video and audio remain at their highest quality with no latency upon delivery. Fully integrated with Evertz MAGNUM-AV MMA10G-TRXS is a managed element of the MMA-10G network which is controlled by MAGNUM-AV. MAGNUM-AV simpliﬁes the management and control over the system and allows for simple user control using Evertz virtual control panels and touch friendly graphical user interfaces (VUE) or via third party control systems. Remote Monitoring The MMA10G-TRXS can be remotely monitored via SNMP protocol using Evertz award winning VistaLINK Pro NMS soware suite. VistaLINK allows a single user from a single workstaon complete visibility into the operaon of the MMA-10G ecosystem. Prevent issues from becoming outages quickly and easily using Evertz’ VistaLINK Pro. Rev. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
