Machines are managed by Trevor B. and Jody G. For the majority of issues you can escalate to one of them. We do not have vSphere access to these machines at this time, so if they are powered off or not responding you will need to reach out to someone to resolve. In order to connect to AWS prompters, you must do so with PCoIP. Using RDP/RDM/VNC will not work. You must also have configured OpenVPN on your system. Disable Global Protect and enable OpenVPN. You must import the VPN certificate, use your own Vprod credentials to configure the certificate. VPN certificate can be found in the folder this document is in. Enable the profile in OpenVPN and wait for it to connect. Once connected open PCoiP and use the host name tera-apca.vprod.io. Then you can use the usernames listed in the spreadsheet to connect.
