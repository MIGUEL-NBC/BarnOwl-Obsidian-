With Flex’s native Web- based configuration interfaces, wide range of tactile control surfaces, and onboard bridging of control technologies, it affords vast new, more affordable ways to meet your control challenges head-on. Whether you are replacing an impossible-to-support custom solution, extending the life of your equipment, or integrating sophisticated control with multiformat delivery, the DNF Flex Control Network is the cost-effective solution you need. Innovation for Flexibility and Efficiency Today's media facilities comprise more disparate technology than ever before, and all these systems need to be networked, managed, and controlled in fundamentally new ways. Designed for enhanced scalabil- ity, the Ethernet-based Flex Control Network is engineered from the ground up for easy integration. You can easily add control resources on-site or remotely via the network Flex Control Network® is DNF’s modular platform of professional IP-based machine controllers. The Flex platform consists of 25 types of intelligent devices and interfaces that can combine to create systems for solving even the most complex control problems. Customized combinations of Flex products create an infrastructure that delivers both centralized and distributed control over machinery and workflows in any industry or scenario. With its advanced design and secure embedded OS, Flex is unlike anything on the market. Flex offers infinite possibilities for controlling, monitoring, and managing networked devices over LAN, WAN, and the Internet. With Flex, you can control almost anything in your facility from anywhere in the world using DNF’s Web services from your computer, tablet, smartphone, or any other Web- enabled device. No one offers more advanced capabilities or custom functional- ity for integrating your products and workflows, and we’re always there to assist with system design and technical support. Flex Control Network Control the Devices That Control Your Broadcast The Business of Flex Flex Control Network provides a complete control and connectivity infrastructure that: Production Control Room #1 Production Control Room #2 Machine Room Master Control Broadcast/Network Operations Center Remote Production/Facility Flex Control Network offers infinite possibilities for centralized and distributed control infrastructures Integrates with existing equipment, protecting equipment investments Incorporates new equipment and technological advances to streamline processes and increase efficiencies, minimizing expenses and increasing profitability Maintains tried and proven existing workflows and integrates new workflows that support time-accurate delivery of quality product, maximiz- ing staff productivity and training efficiency Improves system reliability, supports system expansion, and simplifies system maintenance while minimiz- ing short-term and long-term cost of ownership Fits your application and budget Gives you peace of mind − no more custom boxes, hand-built relay systems, one-off kluged solutions, or custom software Flex Control Network is designed and configured for your specific needs and is backed by the leader in control solutions. control | monitoring | inter facing V: 818.898.3380 F: 818.898.3360 sales@dnfcontrols.com www.dnfcontrols.com for live events; and when manual interven- tion is required, control of remotely located resources in the next building or around the world. Remote Production Control — The Flex Control Network makes it easy to roll late breaking news to air using resources at a remote facility. It simplifies remote produc- tions and allows multiple facilities to share resources, saving time and money. A Flex Control infrastructure also provides tally integration for any remote location. Tally Control — Flex provides simple-to-use studio and facility wide on-air tally control. GTP-32 Control Processor — As a facility’s central control infrastructure, the GTP-32 provides powerful GPI routing, serial and Ethernet monitoring, control, and interfac- ing. Adaptable and extensible, it is easy to configure, simple to use, and requires no programming or scripting. Control Your Whole Facility From Anywhere Manage any device via RS232, RS422, GPI/O, SNMP, UDP, TCP/IP, LAN, WAN, VPN, and Internet. Because you can control all your equipment from the same room, between floors, across campus buildings, or around the world, Flex links geographically separated facilities and connects countries. This exclusive point-to-point and shared control structure permits easy redistribution of your broadcast, production, or automa- tion workload for staffing flexibility. Opera- tors and supervisors can manage the same device, and quickly and easily change control locations for one-time, special, and remote events. Flex Control Network is deployed at leading broadcasters and production facilities around the world, including ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC, HBO, CNN, TURNER, ESPN, Fox News, MLB Cable, TV GLOBO, RAI, NBC Olympics, and more. without rewriting code or rebooting the system. The result is highly reliable perfor- mance and dramatically simplified upgrad- ability with minimal downtime, you scale and adapt the system as your requirements change. More than a mere controller, Flex Control Network represents a distinctively robust, dynamic, and secure infrastructure to elevate your system designs to higher levels of performance and reliability. Compared to other control systems, Flex provides a pronounced increase in processing power and speed with rock-solid networking and IP operation, and a unique modular distrib- uted architecture for responsive real-time control. Control Made Easy Flex consists of a wide variety of intelligent devices and interfaces for controlling production playout systems, multiviewers, routers, video switches, production switch- ers, camera/on-air tallies, master control switchers, VTRs/DDRs, video servers, graphic playout devices, logo inserters, audio mixers, camera pedestals, and more. The Flex Control Network offers hardware- based tactile control surfaces, browser- based interfaces for ease of use and deployment, and simple push-button opera- tion for sophisticated, automated control. Production Control — Flex provides fast, reliable control over video and graphic playout devices for scripted and live programming such as news, sports, and talk shows under manual or MOS driven playout. Whether filling in the control gaps of your existing production systems or as a complete, live production control system, Flex is equally at home. Playout Center/BOC/NOC/Master Control — Flex is mission critical 24/7 control for automation playout and backup, emergency bypass control for primary and backup on-air signals and tactile, manual override Leveraging 20+ Years of Must- Work Control Solutions Flex Control Network is based on DNF’s more than 20 years of experience provid- ing “must work,” mission-critical control systems for broadcast and production operations. Any industry can benefit from that experience with the Flex Control Network. DNF Controls’ core competencies: Extensive knowledge, understanding, and use of equipment control protocols for television broadcast, television production, live and sports production, industrial video, military, and profes- sional corporate uses Extensive knowledge and understand- ing of human interaction with equip- ment and technology to provide fast, easy, reliable, and repeatable control and workflow Providing control integration solutions technology, hardware, and software that enable a wide range of equip- ment from different manufacturers with dissimilar control protocols to co-exist successfully in an integrated system under human and machine control","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
