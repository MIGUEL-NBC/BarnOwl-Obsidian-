Page 1 of 6 Data Sheet Cisco DCM Series D9902 Digital Content Manager Today’s digital systems demand powerful, flexible, and compact solutions that allow content providers and service providers to support new network architectures. The Cisco® DCM Series D9902 Digital Content Manager is a compact and versatile 2RU platform that supports various applications from content contribution, content production, primary distribution, and secondary distribution. The DCM Series D9902 Digital Content Manager includes the following: ● Broadcast quality and high density transrating and transcoding of MPEG-2 and H.264 compressed video and audio services. ● Multiple feed receptions of DVB®-S/S2, multi-decryption and processing of MPEG-2 services. ● Flexible and versatile remultiplexing, grooming, and scrambling of DVB and ATSC services. ● Highly reliable and efficient transport of SDI video, AES Audio, and ASI transport stream signals Figure 1. Cisco DCM Series D9902 Digital Content Manager chassis Physical Configuration The DCM Series D9902 comes in a compact 2RU chassis with hot-swappable and redundant power supplies. The unit has four individual slots. These four slots can contain any combination of the following cards: ● GbE I/O Card ● ASI I/O Card & ASI SFN Card ● Dense Receiver Decrypter Card ● Transcoder and Logo Insertion card (MPEG-2 to AVC) ● Multi Format Processor (MFP) Card – in a Dual Layer or a Single Layer variant ● IP Video Gateway Cards © 2012 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. This document is Cisco Public. Page 2 of 6 Redundancy and Reliability The DCM Series D9902 chassis has been designed to help operators configure highly reliable networks. It supports hot-swappable and redundant power supplies and hot-swappable cooling fans, and the chassis can be configured in a hot 1:1 configuration to support maximum up-time, with minimum switch-over interruption. To maximize service availability, the DCM Series D9902 also offers port, stream, and service redundancy. Security Functions Today’s IP attack profiles cover operating systems, networks, applications, and protocols. These attacks can cause hours or days of downtime, affecting availability of resources and creating serious breaches in data confidentiality and integrity. Depending on the level of the attack and the type of information compromised, the consequences vary in degree, from mildly inconvenient to completely debilitating, and the cost of troubleshooting and recovery can be considerable. To cope with the increased complex and open nature of the IP network environment, the DCM Series D9902 is designed with robust and comprehensive security features. User Interface and Management The DCM Series D9902 chassis is controlled via an easy and intuitive GUI. To keep things simple, there is no software to load on the user’s computer. The GUI of the DCM Series D9902 is a HTML-based user interface that can be opened using Microsoft Internet Explorer or Firefox. The GUI supports simple program provisioning through drag-and-drop functionality. The interface provides detailed information to the user, displaying the DCM Series D9902 configuration, input and output bit rate measurements, packet loss statistics, SDI video bit errors, transport stream alarms, and other information. For easy access to content details, sorting of program information can be performed on various program criteria, including input and output ports, bit rates, and program names. For integrated network monitoring and control, the DCM Series D9902 is integrated with ROSA® Network Management and Control (NMC) system. All functionality available via the HTML interface is available with the ROSA control system. Features and Benefits System ● 60 Gbps internal processing throughput, with a potential future I/O capability of up to 40 Gbps ● User hot-swappable power supplies and fans ● Redundant load-sharing power supplies, supports both AC and DC power supplies Management ● SNMP traps ● ROSA management ● Easy control using web browser ● Ethernet interface for communication with management system and web browser ● IPsec ● General-purpose inputs © 2012 Cisco and/or its affiliates.
