Cross Point Block (1) XPT-31 board (MVS-8000X/7000X) This XPT-31 board configures a 160 x 160 serial matrix. Input signals IN1 to IN70 and the internal reentry signal are input to this XPT-31 board, and are then sent to the M/E block and the output processor block through the matrix. The cross point block is controlled by the CPU module board on the XPT-31 board. (2) XPT-31A board (MKS-8180X) The XPT-31A board configures a 160 Ã— 160 serial matrix. Input signals IN71 to IN140 are input to this XPT-31A board, and are then sent to the M/E block and the output processor block through the matrix. The cross point block is controlled by the CPU module board on the XPT-31 board. (3) CNI-37 board (MVS-8000X/7000X, MKS-8180X) The CNI-37 board is a 20-channel input connector board on the rear panel of the unit. The CNI-37 board corrects the characteristics of 20-channel input signals by the cable equalizer circuit and the re- clocker circuit, and outputs the corrected signals through the motherboard to the XPT-31 or XPT-31A board.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
