Installation Install front panel by reversing steps of removal procedure. 5 MKS-2700 5 Cleaning 1. Front panel Filter on rear of front panel can easily accumulate dust. Remove dust by cleaning as follows. 1. Remove front panel. 2. Remove dust accumulated on filter with a vacuum cleaner. Cleaning filter by washing it in water is recommended when there is a heavy accumulation of dust. Dry filter completely after it has been washed clean by water. 6 MKS-2700 6 Cleaning 2. Fan Inside of DCU-2000-C is cooled by a fan (right side on rear). If dust has accumulated in intake of fan, air is prevented from flowing smoothly and this may result in a temperature rise inside machine. This may have an adverse effect on performance and life of machine. Cleaning of fan every month is recommended. 7 MKS-2700 7 Replacing Connector Board Removal 1. Loosen two fixing screws. 2.

The CPU-DK module (main CPU board) that is connected to CN101 of the IF-963 board controls the Ethernet Controller. The control signal passes through the MB-1050 board, and establishes communication with the Center Control Panel (CCP) at CN104 of the CN-2586 board on the rear. The CPU-DK module establishes interface with PIO on the IF-963 board by receiving command from the Center Control Panel. The Tally/GPI input signal that is input to CN103 on the CN-2586 board on the rear, passes through the MB-1050 board, and is input to PIO on the IF-963 board. The CPU-DK module reads out contents of the PIO and sends the Center Control Panel of the contents. The REF video signal that is input to CN105 of the CN-2586 board or CN207 of the CN-2587 board on the rear is sent to the sync separator circuit where the sync signal is generated. The IF-963 board contains the 36 channels of the Tally Output and the GPI Output circuits. Each channel is used either as Tally or GPI. The information whether each channel is used as Tally or GPI is memorized in the Center Control Panel side to which the MKS-2700 Device Control Unit (DCU) is connected. The Tally Output data and the GPI Output data are written in the PIO from the main CPU. The Tally Output data and GPI Output data turn on and off the relays and feed the output connectors CN101 to CN102 of the CN-2586 board on the rear slot via the MB-1050 board. The IF-963 board contains the six channels of the RS-422A interface circuit that controls VTRs and other equipment. All of the six channels can be used as the Serial GPI Output as desired. With all the SIOs combined, the six channels of the RS-422A can be controlled. The control data establishes interface with the external equipment at CN201 to CN206 (REMOTE 1 to 6) of the CN-2587 board on the rear slot via the MB-1050 board through the driver/receiver complying with the RS-422A standard. The power supply voltages of +3.3 V and +5 V within the IF-963 board are generated using the DC-DC converter from +12 V supplied from the power supply unit via the MB-1050 board, and the power supply voltage of +1.5 V is generated using the regulator from +3.3 V generated from the DC-DC converter. The relays are directly driven by +12 V. 18 DCU-2000-C 18 MKS-2700 MAINTENANCE IF-963 Software Recovery (If software is damaged) 1. Remove the two screws and take off the bracket 2.
