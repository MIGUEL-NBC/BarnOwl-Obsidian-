If your desired device does not appear, you may require a software update. After selecting your device type, the Manually Add Device window will then give you the opportunity to add a friendly name and the device IP Address: Page | 24 Populate these fields. Any incorrect entries will result in an error icon being displayed next to the field: Click “APPLY”: The device will now appear in the Devices list: Page | 25 IMPORTANT NOTE: Please be aware of the following during Device Addition - When a device is connected and assigned with a static IP address, any previously added auto- discovered profile for the device should be deleted. - Once this now statically assigned device is deployed, it should then be manually added to the Device pane. If the auto-discovered profile is retained, it may connect. However, if for any reason the connection is interrupted, it will not re-connect This interruption could be for a number of reasons: - WinPlus-IP application is restarted - The device is removed from network and re-mounted to network - The device powered off and back on - The network activity times out Adding A Wireless Controller Please note: the WB-IP (A9009-0008) should be added to the WP-IP system before the WC-IP (A90009-0007). The WB-IP can be added either by the Auto Discover method (Add Discovered Device) or by manually adding the device (Manually Add Device). The WC-IP must be added using the Auto Discover method (Add Discovered Device) Adding The WB-IP Power: Connect an ethernet cable to the WB-IP. This must be a powered connection, either from a PoE switch or from a PoE injector. Once connected and powered, in the devices window click the + icon: This will launch the Add Discovered Device window: Page | 26 When “Add Discovered Device” is clicked, a list of the available WB-IP connected to the network will populate. The window shows the type of device available, its friendly name, its IP address and MAC address. The WB-IP is displayed below: Double click to add the WB-IP. It will now appear in the Devices list: When connected the Status light will show as Green. Once the base station is connected switch on the Wireless Controller (WC-IP) Page | 27 Adding The WC-IP In the devices window click the + icon: This will launch the Add Discovered Device window: When “Add Discovered Device” is clicked, a list of the available WC-IP connected to the network will populate. The window shows the type of device available, its friendly name and its MAC address. The WC-IP is displayed below: Double click to add. The WC-IP will now appear in the Devices pane. Page | 28 Pairing the WC-IP to the WB-IP The WC-IP will be automatically linked to an available WB-IP. The devices pane will show which WB-IP Basestation it is connected to. In the below example the WC-IP is named “WC-IP Rob1” The devices pane shows “WC-IP Rob1” is connected to WinPlus-IP via Basestation WB-IP 88-99-A9. In the WC-IP name column it displays the name of the WP-IP “WC-IP Rob1”, and then the WB-IP it is using to connect to the WinPlus-IP application by showing the name in brackets (via WB-IP 88-99-A9) The device menu is the same as with the other controllers except there is more information. It shows the battery level both graphically and by %, the connection state, and the Basestation it is connected to: Page | 29 Displaying Device IP Address To display the device IP address in the devices pane, click the burger then Columns/IP Address Displaying Device Ownership To display the name of the machine which currently has ownership of a device, in the Devices pane click the burger then Columns/Controlled By: This column will display the users name @ the machine device name. The users name is the name they are logged into the machine with. The device name is as seen in the About details of your PC In the above example the user is BrownR and the machine name is UKBUR-PC0YQFX1. To take control of the Device In the below example the WP-IP user is BrownR@UKBUR-PC0YQFX1. The user wants to take control of an XBOX-IP which is in use by AnisR@UKTW1-004030 To take control of the Device, click to highlight then right click and select Take Control of Selected Page | 30 You are then given an option to proceed: Clicking Yes will result in BrownR@UKBUR-PC0YQFX1 taking over that device. On AnisR@UKTW1-004030’s machine this will now show as Blue and the owner will be shown as BrownR@UKBUR-PC0YQFX1 Page | 31 Device Status Light Devices can have multiple states. The light in the Status column of the Devices window illustrates the state. Hover over the light to see details of the status Grey Light with Red Line: Disabled Blue Light: Busy (in use by another WP-IP) Green Light: Connected Orange Light: Connecting Purple Light: Device Type Mismatch Blue Up Arrow: Updating Script (this may flash intermittently) Re-ordering Devices Devices can be dragged and dropped to reorder them in the Devices pane. This is particularly useful if devices are to be ordered by type and a new device is added. Page | 32 Configuring CLOCKPLUS-IP Device The CLOCKPLUS-IP can be configured through the WinPlus-IP Device pane. Highlight the device the clock is installed in and click the CONFIGURATION button: In the Device Configuration Window, click CONFIGURATION, Click the CLOCK MODULE tab: Make sure the clock is ENABLED: Check the TIME ZONE and 12/24 hour preference and click APPLY. To get time from the WinPlus-IP NTP synchronized host, select RTC: Page | 33 Connecting IP devices Across Different Networks All Autoscript IP devices (IP monitors, IP controllers, Xbox-IP) will send out a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) discovery broadcast beacon as soon as the device is powered on and has completed booting. The device will continue to generate the discovery beacon while it is powered. The WP-IP application will detect the discovery beacon and add the device to the Available Devices list within WP-IP The ability for WP-IP to automatically discover devices via the discovery beacon is only possible when the laptop/PC running WP-IP, and the devices themselves, are on the same LAN (local area network) broadcast domain. Usually the laptop/PC running WP-IP will be on the same LAN as the devices. This relationship is most common in locations where all devices are in the same building and are on an internal network; in a large broadcast television studio for example. However, there may be cases where the WP-IP application is running on a laptop/PC in a different location from the other devices. For example, an outside broadcast where the prompter laptop/PC is in a studio and the presenter is some distance away. In this case the remote devices may not be on the same LAN as the laptop/PC running WP-IP. The connection of the devices is therefore different: • Devices connected to the same LAN as the laptop/PC running WP-IP will be auto discoverable in WP-IP via the discovery beacon they are broadcasting. • Devices not connected to the same LAN as the laptop/PC running WP-IP will not be auto discoverable in WP-IP via the discovery beacon they are broadcasting. A route between the two networks is required which will enable the IP devices to connect to WP-IP. Using a VPN IP Tunnel An IP tunnel is an IP network communications channel between two networks. It is used to transport another network protocol by encapsulation of its packets. Using this method IP devices can be connected to WP-IP when they are not on the same network. Where a VPN IP tunnel is used the device will need to be entered manually in WP-IP using its IP address. There are specific ports which devices use, and the VPN/firewall must be configured to allow traffic to pass over these ports. Port 5000 Used for: • All IP monitors: EVO-IP, EPIC-IP, EVO-IP • XBOX-IP • iEVO (iDevice application) Please Note: to update firmware on these devices traffic must also be able to pass over Port 22 Page | 34 Port 5038 Used for: • HC-IP • FC-IP • WHC-PKG Please Note: to update firmware on these devices traffic must also be able to pass over Port 69 Additional Information: WinPlus machine discovery: WP-IP uses a proprietary protocol using UDP broadcasts on port 52385. IP Controller/Xbox/IP Monitor discovery: These devices use a proprietary protocol using UDP broadcasts on port 526. Layers: WP-IP uses the full networking stack including layers 2 and 3.

Click to select then hold down left mouse button and drag to reorder. Please Note: The live Run Order can be moved in this way when active, you do not have to deactivate it to move it. Dual Rundown Mode This enables the user to view, edit and check the status of one Run Order while prompting a different Run Order. This is a useful tool for when the operator needs to make changes to one script without stopping the prompting output of another script. In the following example I have 3 Run Orders loaded: • Script 1 • Script 2 • Script 3 I want to prompt and edit Script 1. I right click on Script 1 and select Prompt and Edit Run Order Page | 57 This results in the following: Script 1 is now in the Story Editor pane and the Prompter Preview pane (the live script). To confirm, they both show the same title. In addition Script 1 is in red in the Run Orders window signifying that it is the live Run Order I now want to edit the content of Script 2 but do not want to stop prompting Script 1. I right click on Script 2 (it goes blue signifying I have selected it) and choose Edit Run Order Page | 58 This results in the following: Script 2 is now in the Story Editor pane and Script 1 is still the Prompter Preview pane (the live script) To confirm, the title bar of the Story Editor pane and the Prompt Preview pane show the two different Run Orders. Script 1 is in red in the Run Orders window signifying that it is the live Run Order Script 2 is in green signifying that it is now in the Story Editor I now want to prompt the content of Script 2 but want to edit Script 1. I right click on Script 2 (it has a blue border outlining the green signifying I have selected it) and choose Prompt Run Order. Page | 59 Script 2 is now in both the Story Editor pane and the Prompt Preview pane (the live script) I then right click on Script 1 (it goes blue signifying I have selected it) and choose Edit Run Order. This results in the following: Page | 60 Script 1 is now in the Story Editor pane and Script 2 is still in the Prompter Preview pane (the live script) To confirm, the title bar of the Story Editor pane and the Prompt Preview pane show the two different Run Orders. Script 2 is in red in the Run Orders window signifying that it is the live Run Order Script 1 is in green signifying that it is now in the Story Editor Please Note: Whichever Run Down is selected to be in the Story Editor pane will also be in the Active Run Order pane By using these options the user can preview and edit one script while live prompting another. Automatically Scroll from One Run Down Into the Next In many instances multiple run downs are loaded in WP-IP. This is a common mode of operation with news production, when different news hours have different rundowns, or in conference presentations where different speakers have different scripts. The common factor is that the scripts will run consecutively. When this feature is enabled the prompter will automatically scroll from the end of one rundown into the start of the next. To access this feature click the burger in the Prompt Preview pane and then Auto Prompt Next/Previous Run Order Page | 61 Moving Stories Please Note: This feature is not applicable when a Newsroom connection is established as story moves should always come from the NRCS.

Page | 69 Run Order Options When Importing Scripts Several parameters can be set when importing a run order. These include setting the number of blank lines to be removed on import and when a new line is to be created Please Note: these preferences are universally applied so are not specific to any NRCS or text editor. To view the Run Order Import options, click Settings/Preferences You will now be presented with several tabs. Page | 70 Limit maximum number of blank lines imported This option lets you control how many blank lines are imported and how many are removed. Often a script will be prepared where the writer has entered several blank lines to separate segments, paragraphs etc. The reader may not want to see these and so can determine the number of lines displayed on the prompter. To enable this function, check the box and then enter the number of blank lines you require to remain in the field to the right: E.g.: With the above settings, when a run order is imported which has 4 blank lines, 3 of those blank lines will be removed. To switch this function off uncheck the box. Please Note: this option applies both to when run orders are imported and when text is copy/pasted into the Story Editor window. New line after “.”, “?” or “!” This feature will force a new line (carriage return) when a “.”, “?” or “!” is detected. To enable this feature, check the box and then enter the number of spaces that must be detected after the “.”, “?” or “!” to apply the carriage return. Please Note: The spaces are not removed; the carriage return is placed after the number in the “Spaces After” field and any additional spaces are carried over to the newly created line The following examples use the sample text below Page | 71 Using the sample text and the “Spaces After” set to 0: Will produce the following result: A new line is forced after the ? There are 2 spaces following it. These 2 spaces are forced onto the next line before There. A new line is forced after the ! A new line is forced after the . There are 3 spaces following it. The 3 spaces are forced onto the next line before END. Page | 72 Using the same text and the “Spaces After” set to 2: Will produce the following result: A new line is forced after the ? because there are 2 spaces following it . These spaces are on the same line after the ? A new line is not forced after the ! because there are no spaces. A new line is forced after the . because there are 3 spaces. 2 of the spaces remain on the same line as after the . and the third space is forced onto the next line before END. Page | 73 Tab handling Removal/replacement of tabs within text is done using the options: o Number of spaces to replace starting tabs o Number of spaces to replace non- starting tabs Using the following text as an example: Entering a different value will affect the tabs. For example, with these settings: The results are: Page | 74 The two tabs at the start of the first sentence (starting tabs) are removed and replaced by 4 spaces. Number of spaces to replace starting tabs = 2 There are 2 x Tabs so total spaces to replace tabs is 4. The three tabs in the middle of the second sentence (non-starting tabs) are removed and replaced by 3 spaces Number of spaces to replace non-starting tabs = 1 There are 3 x Tabs so total spaces to replace tabs is 3. With these settings: The results are: The two tabs at the start of the first sentence (starting tabs) are removed and replaced by 2 spaces. Number of spaces to replace starting tabs = 1. There are 2 x Tabs so total spaces to replace tabs is 2. The three tabs in the middle of the second sentence (non-starting tabs) are removed and replaced by 12 spaces. Number of spaces to replace non-starting tabs = 4. There are 3 x Tabs so total spaces to replace tabs is 12. Page | 75 TIPS Import Handling This feature supports the import of scripts from the TIPS word processor system. This is most specifically in use by the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation). If not using TIPS to import scripts this feature can be ignored WP-IP can handle conversion of three import tags from within scripts generated in TIPS. These are: • %%B or %%b: Start of Story • %%I or %%i: Inverse Video On • %%V or %%v: Inverse Video Off When Handle TIPS %% tags is enabled these tabs are converted to the format specified above. Please Note: The number following the %%B or %%b will be used as the story number. This will also generate a slugline. The parameters of the slugline and story text is defined by the Presenter Settings. The below is an example of a sample of a TIPS rundown opened in Notepad: When the feature is disabled: And the TIPS document is imported, the resulting conversion is: Page | 76 When the feature is enabled: And the TIPS document is imported, the resulting conversion is: Please Note: Additional TIPS %% tags may be supported in future versions. Page | 77 Please Note: The availability and number of shortcut keys is subject to change with subsequent application releases. A software update may be required. Not all options are included listed.

Then click the “+” button Enter the presenters name in the Name field in the General Tab. This will autofill the presenters name in the parent name field. For example, Presenter John: When the presenters name is displayed, the presenters name will be shown in the format selected in the Prompt Name field of the Font Styles tab: That will result in Presenter John displayed as below: Page | 98 You can also enter a friendly name in the General tab. For example, “Johns Story” By changing the colour, font size and other parameters in the Prompt Name field of the Font Styles tab to the below: The resulting output is: Click Apply to save these settings and add the new Presenter to the list. Display the Presenters Name The option to display the presents name can also be found under the General Tab of each presenter. There are two options: Hide or After Slugline Page | 99 When hide is selected the presenters name will not be shown. When After Slugline is selected the presenters name will be shown. Please Note: It is not required to reload the Run Order to apply these changes Please Note: Display of the presenter’s name can also be determined by the bracket settings within a NRCS. See the section Newsroom Preferences/Bracket Options. Page | 100 Configure Presenter Settings Within the presenter settings a default global setting is used for the following 4 tabs: • Prompter Layout • Blanking • Cue Marker • Clock i.e. within each presenter these settings can be left unchanged and so they will default to the Global Settings, or they can be modified per presenter. IMPORTANT: to determine the Global Settings see the section “Prompter Preview Preferences” & “Prompter Preview Layout Formatting” When one of these 4 tabs is selected “Override Global Settings” is unchecked. For example, the Blanking tab. If you do not want to use the global settings of the Blanking feature for Presenter John, select Presenter John, then the Blanking tab and check the “Override Global Settings” box: This will result in an editable box opening. Check the “Show Message” box and enter some text. E.g. TEST TEXT. Click APPLY to close the box.

When disabled WP-IP will not be able to read encrypted messages sent from iNews Passive Mode When Passive Mode FTP is enabled the connection is only one way, i.e. WP-IP connects to the iNews server so only one direction of firewall needs to be opened. Passive only needs ONE direction of firewall open. When unchecked (Active Mode FTP) the iNews server connects BACK to WP-IP to send stories. This means connections are made in BOTH directions, requiring firewalls to be opened in both directions. Please Note: Passive Mode FTP can consume more network connections to the iNews FTP server than Active Mode FTP. When the number of connections are limited it may be better suited to use Active Mode FTP, because then half the time the iNews server connects to WP-IP, which does not consume a connection. In either case, the iNews FTP server itself may not be configured to support both Passive and Active options. Please consult with your iNews administrator to confirm the best mode of operation. Page | 137 Limit Connections When enabled the number of FTP connections between WP-IP and the iNews FPT server will be limited. Max Connections This enables the user to determine the maximum number of FTP connections used by WP-IP when connecting to iNews.

Redundancy provides a failover system with minimal set-up and delay in switching in the event of an issue. All devices on the network, including controllers and on-camera monitors, are instantly transferred from control of the main machine to the standby machine with a single click. This feature is available in the following versions: • WP-IPN • WP-IP • WP Evaluation When redundancy is active and initiated all features of the live machine will be paired and replicated on the stand by machine. This includes Presenter settings Please Note: Layout settings will not be replicated on the standby machine. Configuring Redundancy Please Note: Both the Active and Stand-By machine must both have the same Licence Type (WP-IP, WP-IPN) and be operating the same software version. To check your version see Help/About. They must also be on the same subnet in order to connect. To initialise Redundancy click Settings/Redundancy. This will launch the Redundancy Pairing window. Pairing is required to enable the connection between the two systems. The window displays the ID of the machine. Page | 162 Any machine on the same subnet running the WP-IP application will automatically appear in the Redundancy Pairing window in the Hostname column. Details of the software version and WP-IP licence type will also be displayed Please Note: To pair two applications this operation must also be performed on a second WP-IP application. Click on the Hostname you want to connect to and click Pair While the systems are pairing a window will launch which displays the status • Blinking red to yellow: Pairing • Solid Red: Paired/Standby The paired hostname will be displayed. Page | 163 When paired the TAKE CONTROL button will become active. Clicking TAKE CONTROL will assign that machine to the live machine. The Standby window will close. The STANDBY window on the second machine will now display in green signifying that it is activey paired. When paired the message panel in the bottom right of the WP-IP application will display the status of the redundancy connection. The two images below show how the Live machine and the Standby machine: Live machine: Page | 164 Standby machine: When in standby the devices will show a green monitor icon beside the Blue (busy) status light: This icon denotes the device is paired and is connected to the live machine. Swapping Redundant Machines To take control on the standby machine click TAKE CONTROL. All devices will transfer from the live machine to the standby machine. The device status light will go from Blue (busy) to Green (connected) on the live machine. The status icon will disappear. The live machine will now automatically become the standby machine.

When connected to the same network an iDevice with the iEVO app will show as a device within the WP-IP device manager. Once activated it will receive the prompting data from WP-IP over Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet adaptor, enabling the script to be rendered in the iDevice so that it becomes an additional monitor. This offers a unique and flexible solution for prompting, controlled like a standard on-camera unit. Licence & Software Requirements Autoscript Licence Required WP-I Autoscript Supported software • WinPlus-IP • WinPlus-IPN • WinPlus-IPS version 1.3 or higher Supported Apple devices iPad Pro iPad Air iPad Mini iPhone Supported Apple OS 10 or higher Page | 200 Purchasing a WP-I Licence To enable the connection between the WP-IP application and your iPad/iPhone you will require a licence. This is sales part: WP-I Sales Part Description: iPad licence, single device Note: Each incidence of iEVO will require a separate licence. You can connect multiple iPads/iPhones to the WP-IP application, but each will require a separate iEVO licence. You can share licences amongst iPads. For example, if you have 3 x iPads and 2 x iPhones and 3 x WP-I licences you can add up to 3 x iDevices to the WP-IP application. These can be any combination of the 5 x iDevices, the licence is not locked to specific iPads or iPhones. Please contact your local Autoscript sales representative for pricing. To Activate Your WP-I Licence Open WinPlus-IP on the operating PC by double clicking on the WinPlus-IP icon on the desktop: Copy the machine id from the Licence Management window: Register the machine id and serial id(s) at: http://www.autoscript.tv/support/register-product-software/ Page | 201 You can access that page through WP-IP directly here: A licence key will be sent to the registered email address. Copy the licence key into the Key field in the Licence Management window in WinPlus-IP: Once the licence is accepted WP-IP will display iPad as part of your licence description in the WP-IP header: You will now be able to add an iPad or iPhone to your list of devices. Please Note: If you have WP-IP already installed, and then add the WP-I feature, you will receive a licence that includes both products and you will not lose any functionality. Downloading the iEVO Application The iEVO application must be downloaded and installed on the appropriate iPad device. The app can be downloaded for free. Access the App Store from the iPad you wish to install the iEVO app on. Search for Autoscript iEVO. Page | 202 Connection Requirements iEVO requires a wired or wireless network connection to connect to WP-IP. When iEVO is installed on the iDevice and opened the app will send out a UDP (User Datagram Protocol) broadcast which will make the iEVO application visible to WP-IP. In order for WP-IP to be able to detect this UDP broadcast the laptop/PC running WP-IP will typically be on the same network as the iDevice which iEVO is running on. Please Note: UDP broadcasts do not typically transmit through different subnets. However, IT engineers may be able to configure a route between two networks (tunnel/VPN) which enables iEVO to connect to WP-IP. In this case there should be no issues connecting the iDevice to WP-IP even though they are not on the same network. This will require the device to be entered manually using the VPN IP address. The VPN connection will need to allow traffic on port 5000 for the iEVO application to be able to communicate with WP-IP. If you have issues connecting to iEVO run a ping test to see if you can access it. • Launch the Command Prompt • Type ping (space) IP Address In this example the device IP is 192.168.1.98 Page | 203 iEVO Network Connection Examples Local Network iPad/iPhone Connection Page | 204 Remote Network iPad/iPhone Connection Page | 205 Adding An iDevice To The WP-IP application Once you have installed the iEVO application on your connected iDevice and have the appropriate licence installed on your WP-IP application you can add the iDevice. In the devices window click the + icon: This will launch the Add Discovered Device window: You now have two options: Option 1: Add Auto Discovered Device Option 2: Manually Add Device Page | 206 Adding An Auto Discovered Device When “Add Discovered Device” is clicked, a list of the available iDevices connected to the network will populate. The window shows the type of device available, its friendly name, its IP address and MAC address. Please Note: For the iDevice to be discovered iEVO must be running on the iDevice In the below example WP-IP has auto discovered an iPad on the network with the name Jib iPad: When the device is added to the devices list it will disappear from the Add Discovered Device window and appear in the Devices list: Any new devices subsequently attached to the network will become visible in the Add Discovered Device window. If an iDevice is detected and added, but it is on a different subnet, a window will open which alerts the user of this and asks of you want to set the IP address: Page | 207 Click No to close this window. WP-IP can not remotely set the Subnet Mask in the iDevice. Changes to the iDevice Subnet Mask (and IP address) must be done locally on the iDevice network settings. Please Note: If you do not edit the Subnet Mask to match that of the appropriate network the device will be added to the Devices window but you will not be able to use that device. Once the Subnet of the iDevice is edited to match that of the network which the laptop/PC running WP-IP is also connected to you will be able to repeat the first steps of Adding An Auto Discovered Device to add your iDevice. Manually Adding A Device If a device is connected to the network or VPN but is not visible in the Add Discovered Device window, the user may manually add the device. In the devices window click the + icon: Page | 208 This will launch the Add Discovered Device window: Click “Manually Add Device”: The Manually Add Device window will open. Click “Select” to view a pull-down of the available device types: Page | 209 After selecting your iDevice the Manually Add Device window will then give you the opportunity to add a friendly name and the device IP Address: Populate these fields. Any incorrect entries will result in an error icon being displayed next to the field. Click “APPLY”. The device will now appear in the Devices list: Page | 210 Configuring an iDevice The iPad will display exactly the same image as that of all other on-camera units. As with the other devices there are configurable options. To access these right click on the iDevice and select Edit or click on the Configuration button: If the prompting is currently Live you will see the message: If you choose to continue you will see the Configuration window: This window shows you device information and connection status. This enables you to disable or enable the iDevice. Page | 211 Please Note: Enabling or Disabling of the device can also be done by right clicking on the iDevice in the main Devices pane. Click on configuration to access a menu. General Shows the general information for the iPad including the device Serial Number and Firmware version. A yellow triangle alerts you that the Firmware is now out of date. This can be updated from the App Store. Please Note: This will also be shown in the main devices toolbar with a tooltip telling you the iEVO app you have installed needs updating: Identify: Click to display the details of the device on the iDevice itself as Page | 212 The iDevice will show the friendly name, device Serial Number, Firmware version and IP address. Please Note: If prompting is live, clicking Identify will switch the prompting off on the iDevice and it will display the identification screen. You will be shown this confirmation message before applying Identify: If you click “Yes” the identification screen will be displayed for 3 seconds and then will automatically revert to displaying the prompter text. Time Zone This feature allows the user to choose to display a different time zone on the iDevice from that which is generated by the machine which is running WP-IP. Please Note: Display of the time on the iDevice is enabled in the WP-IP application. To show the clock click the burger in the Prompter Preview pane and then click Show Clock: Page | 213 To configure the clock settings, including colour and position, click the burger/Preferences/Clock To use the time generated in the WP-IP application the device is attached to, uncheck the box Use Host Time Zone To use the time set in the location services of the iDevice itself, check the box Use Host Time Zone Display Orientation of the image displayed on the iDevice can be changed in the display tab. When used in a through-the-lens configuration (with a hood and glass) the text will need to be vertically flipped for the presenter to be able to read the reflected image. If the iDevice is not used in a through-the-lens configuration (with a hood and glass) the orientation does not need to be vertically flipped. This is known as straight read configuration and means the image is orientated correctly for hand-held or above lens use. Page | 214 To use the iDevice in a through-the-lens configuration (with a hood and glass) check the box Vertical Flip. To use the iDevice in straight read configuration, uncheck the box Vertical Flip. Prompting Control The loading of script text and speed and direction of the scroll is determined by the operator and controllers which are connected to the WP-IP application. There is no direct local control of the scrolling text in the iEVO application. Script commands sent from the WP-IP application to EVO-IP, EPIC-IP and XBOX-IP are also automatically sent to iEVO. The script is sent as data packets via the network and the image rendering is done within the iEVO application running on the iDevice. If the network connection is lost between iEVO and WP-IP the script will disappear from the iDevice and the application will display the Identify screen. When the connection is re-established iEVO will automatically begin prompting again from the latest position the script is set to by the operator.
