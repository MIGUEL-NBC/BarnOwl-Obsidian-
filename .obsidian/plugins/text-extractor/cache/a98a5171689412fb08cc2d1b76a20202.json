Right now you may only need Bomgar but that may change over time. You can also reset your vprod.io password from this page. You also access Bomgar via SAML authentication; Go to remoteaccess.vprod-global.io/saml This will allow you to sign into Bomgar. In order to authenticate, you will need to use 2 factor authentication using your phone and the OKTA Verify application (available on app store, use your vprod.io credentials to set up) You should now see a BeyondTrust Privileged Remote Access page like below You can use the Privileged Web Access Console but this has some limitations in regards to what you can do. I recommend downloading the access console, make sure to download the version that matches your OS. This will download as an EXE file for Windows. Run the EXE. You will need local admin access on your laptop which can be granted through remediant if you don’t already have admin credentials. Once the application is installed and opened, you will see another log in window like this. Always make sure you are authenticating using SAML credentials. When you click login, you will be taken back to another log in page like you saw on the vprod.okta.com page. Follow the same steps and then you will see a screen like this; If nothing happens here, run the file that downloaded. This will authenticate your local session. If you get an error that says failed to authenticate, click log in again and the file will download again and it should work. Once you have been authenticated, Bomgar UI will open. The main section you will be working in will be the bottom half of the program. Unlike RDM, organization in Bomgar (as of now) is pretty bad. So you will need to know either the host name or IP of the end device. This will hopefully change as we start some organization within Bomgar. By clicking on a device, you can see some statistics that indicate how long the machine has been up, or if it’s on or not. To access these machines, you can right click the system and select jump, or just double click. There are several tools available in Bomgar that are not present in RDM. You can share screen with another user, use pen tools, and most importantly you can file transfer without needing to use TightVNC. You can also get a ton of good info on that machine including Devices, Processes, Events, Programs, and Services.
