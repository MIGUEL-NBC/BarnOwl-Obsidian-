{"path":"Referenced Material/Reference Library/Vendor/Evertz/Evertz/7800EMR-HYDRA2_v2.pdf","text":"The Complete Solution Provider Rev. 16-1 The 7800EMR-HYDRA2 interface module provides existing and new EMR- audio systems to integrate directly to Calrec Hydra2* audio systems, by means of a seamless bidirectional translation between Evertz TDM and Calrec Hydra2. Featuring primary and secondary Hydra2 paths that are capable of 512 bidirectional audio channels (at 48kHz), primary and secondary TDM paths all are monitored and provide an automatic failover mechanism, in addition there is a licensable feature to allow for name transfer, from a Magnum Uniﬁ ed Control System to the Calrec Hydra 2 system for the appropriate audio labels. This joint effort is made possible by the ﬁ tment of a Calrec US6237 H2M-PRO Hydra2 Interface card, which is to be purchased from Calrec, onto the 7800EMR-HYDRA2 interface module. The 7800EMR-HYDRA2 interface module just makes sense, it simpliﬁ es system wiring, conﬁ guration and overall management of the audio signals, monitoring and name transfers, not to mention it provides path redundancy as well as saving rack and module slots space. When we comparison this to a traditional or equivalent system one would require multiple MADI lines to interlinking the systems via numerous MADI conversion boxes on both ends, which to a key point do not have an inherently incorporated path redundancy as seen with Hydra 2 / TDM Audio paths, and then names would be handled in a separate protocol translator card with additional complicated conﬁ guration required. * Hyrda2 is a Trade Mark of Calrec Audio Ltd. 7800EMR-HYDRA2** TDM to Hydra2 bidirectional interface module **Calrec Hydra2 Daughter Card to be purchased from Calrec.
