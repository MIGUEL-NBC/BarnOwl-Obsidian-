{"path":"To Be Organized/30 Rock Global Infrastructure/CCU Mapping/CCU Tracker SOP.docx","text":"CCU Tracker SOP The new CCU Tracker is pretty self-explanatory but this guide is a quick overview on how it works. There is a longer (~15 min) video linked here going over everything in more depth. The tracker is only accessible in 4S SMPTE Core, and soon 3N-ER and 1A FTR. When making patches, this document should be updated with any changes made. The home page of the tracker looks like this: All updating occurs on the CCU Tracker sheet or the 1A Report sheet. The CCU Tracker Home simply shows a view only dashboard of the status of the system according to the main Tracker Sheet. This dashboard is the only aspect of this sheet accessible from any location without account access. Dashboard can be viewed here: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=ffa632c69a7a4188bee88ae6869a2276 The main tracker looks like this: Here you can update the CCU Status and SMPTE patch path whenever changes are made. The patched vs unpatched status of CCU refers to whether the CCU itself is connected to a Camera. The next few columns follow the path down from 4S to 3N. The path tracking is up until it leaves 3N, patching details beyond this point should be up to the operators. This tracker is for new IP CCUs only, not legacy CCUs. Those will be tracked separately. If CR71 takes 3X/3AW Cameras then patching status for CCU 13-16 would be changed to reflect unpatched, and 3NER SMPTE Out field would be left blank. The remaining path from 4S to 3N would be left as it is still valid. All Labels on the sheet have been made to match the labels found in the actual patch bays so it should be a very clear path. Studio Ops designation refers to how operations refer to these CCUs. This will be tweaked as we get more operations feedback and will fully replace the Studio Assignment column, No one but us currently see the Studio Assignment column its for our clarity only. Since 1A CCUs do not pass through 4S SMPTE Core, 1A has itâ€™s own dedicated page for tracking. It is not a fully separate document, changes made on the 1A Report are simultaneously made on the main sheet. The 1A Report looks like this: At this time, if you find there is an option missing in one of the patching dropdowns, you can fill in with anything you manually enter. Please let me know if anything is found missing and I will add to the dropdown options.
