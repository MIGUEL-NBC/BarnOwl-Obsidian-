The numbers for a fully populated EXE28 are calculated based on 16 standard line cards, 16 CXP expansion cards, 4 EXE-XC fabric cards and 2 frame controllers. The calculations are based on all 2304 ports being fully loaded in a 40RU and all 1152 ports being fully loaded in a 28RU while simultaneously transmitting and receiving 1500 byte packets, which represents the worst case for a switch carrying streaming media. 1. The total power consumption for the EXE40 is 18.06 kW. This includes full AC redundancy with six power supply chassis, i.e. 6x 30A circuits per AC - 12 total. The total power consumption for the EXE28 is 9.18kW. This included full AC redundancy with 3 power supply chassis, i.e. 3x 30A circuits per AC – 6 total. 2. The Total Airflow for the EXE40 is approximately 3,470 CFM and approximately 2,040 CFM for the EXE28. The cold air intake is at the front of the unit through the perforated door. The primary exhaust is top-rear for the upper 16 line cards which is approximately 1431 CFM, as well as at the sides for the fabric cards at approximately 608 CFM and lower rear for the lower 16 line cards again at approximately 1431 CFM. 3. The Heat Rise for the EXE40 and the EXE28 is 7.8 oC (14 oF). With 18 o C (65oF) inlet air temperature, the exhaust air temperature will be 25.8.oC (78.5o F). These values are the same for both the 28RU and 40RU frames; the 40RU frame has an additional cooling system for the lower half of the frame. 4. The Noise Level for the EXE40 is 78.6dBA, this value is measured 1ft from the front of the frame at a height of 5ft. This is measured with EX TECH 407730 Digital Sound Level Meter at a Frequency weighting ‘A’ at a slow response curve as per ANSI S1.25-1991 and OSHA measurement guidelines. The EXE fans running at default speed when this measurement was taken. The default fans speed assumes that the all 2304 ports are being utilized and have full line rate and bidirectional traffic with standard Ethernet sized packets (1500 bytes). The default fan settings assume that all electronics in the frame are less than 70o C (158o F) at an ambient temperature of 23o C (73.4o F). EXE FAQ 5. The Weight of a fully loaded EXE40 is 1108lb, with 32 line cards, 32 CXP expansion cards and 4 fabric cards. The weight for a fully loaded EXE28 is 623lb, which has 16 line cards, 16 CXP expansion cards and 4 fabric cards. Both of these weights include the weight of the front door and the top and bottom 5RU air deflectors. The 6. The multi-conductor cable between the power switch and the 1RU power supply chassis (shown in purple in the drawing) is dual function. In addition to controlling the On/Off of the PS from the switch, it also connects the power supply chassis' together for current sharing and is labeled as such in the drawing. This cable is provided with the EXE power switch.
