DEFAULT ETHERNET CONFIGURATION IP Address: 192.168.10.217 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 192.168.10.1 The AIB-4 is configured using a standard web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome). Enter the AIB-4’s IP address in the Address/ URL bar, typically located at the top of the web browser page, to access the Home Page. Use the links on the left side of the Home Page to access the desired configuration web pages. All configuration settings are saved in non-volatile memory in the AIB-4. Settings are retained when power is removed. Settings may be uploaded to a computer as a configuration file (.dnf) for storage. Configuration files may be downloaded from a computer into the AIB-4 to restore a saved configuration. A configuration file contains all of the AIB-4’s configurations except IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address. The AIB-4 does not support partial configuration upload or download. The configuration file is a not a text formatted file. It cannot be viewed or modified with a text editor. To access the System Configuration web page, use the following log-on when prompted.

The AIB-4 will go off-hook and dial the telephone number of the remote device. If no dial tone is detected the AIB will go on-hook, wait, and then re-attempt to dial. If the remote device does not answer within approximately 1 minute, the AIB will go on- hook, wait, and then redial. After remote device answers the call, the two units will negotiate a connection. If this process fails, the AIB-4 will hang up, wait, and then redial. After a successful connection is negotiated, the AIB will send “are you there?” messages to the remote unit. If the remote unit does not respond within 15 seconds, the AIB will hang up, wait, and then redial. To stop the AIB-4 from dialing, change the Operating Mode to Ethernet, DTMF, or Modem Answer.

This label is used in the Event Action Table. GTP-32/ DC20 Event label Enter the GTP-32 or DC20 Event Label to tally. This Event Label must be listed in the GTP-32/ DC20’s Event Notification Table with the IP address of this AIB-4. The entered Event Label must exactly match the event label in the Event Notification Table. User Register Value For use with “UR_” event labels only. Enter a value ‘0’ to ‘255’. When the received User Register value matches the entered value, the event turns ON momentarily NOTE- The GTP-32/ DC20 Receive Event type event is only displayed in the Event Action Table for Remote Devices of Device Type “GTP-32/ DC20”. AIB-4 User Manual Page 14 of 28 AHSC TRANSMIT ACTION Action Label Enter any 32 characters. This label is used in the Event Action Table. ASCII/ HEX Command The ASCII/HEX Command is 1 - 256 characters in length. Use %yz to enter a HEX value. ‘y’ and ‘z’ are values 0 - 9 or A- F. Two characters must follow %. Use %WTttt to add a WAIT time, 001 - 999 milliseconds. Three numbers must follow %WT. The characters preceding %WT are sent immediately. The characters after %WTttt are sent after the wait time expires. More than one %WT can be included in a command. NOTE- %WT is only an approximate wait time. For SERIAL only- Use %BR to add a BREAK character as the first transmitted character. NOTE- Spaces between characters are NOT transmitted. Use %20 to transmit a space character. AIB-4 User Manual Page 15 of 28 AHSC RECEIVE EVENT Pattern matching examples can be found in the back of this manual. Event Label Enter any 32 characters. This label is for convenience only and is used in the Event Action Table. ASCII/ HEX Receive Data Enter 1- 16 characters and/or bit patterns to match against received serial data. The received characters must exactly match the order and value of the entered patterns. If a received character does not match the entered pattern, all previous matches are discarded and the match process begins again with the first entered pattern. If more than 1 second elapses between received characters, all previous matches are discarded and the match process begins again. Use %yz to enter a HEX character. ‘y’ and ‘z’ are values 0 - 9, A - F, or 'X' (don’t care). Enter %Xz to match only the z part of the HEX character. Enter %yX to match only the y part of the HEX character. Enter %XX to ignore the received value. Use #yyyyyyyy to match an exact bit pattern. ‘y’ values are '0', '1', or 'X' (don't care). For example, enter #0XXX1XXX to match bit7= 0 and bit3= 1. Bit0 is on the far right. Bit7 is on the far left. Use <yyyyyyyy to match any bit in the bit pattern. ‘y’ values are '0', '1', or 'X' (don't care). For example, enter <0XXX1XXX to match bit7=0 or bit3= 1. Bit0 is on the far right. Bit7 is on the far left. Use '!' to NOT match a character pattern. For example: Event Label= TEST. Receive pattern= !A. If any character other than 'A' is received, then TEST event is ON. If 'A' is received, then TEST event is OFF. Use !y, !%yz, or !#yyyyyyyy to specify a NOT pattern match. NOTE- Spaces between patterns are ignored. Use %20 to match a space character. AIB-4 User Manual Page 16 of 28 DTMF EVENTS / ACTIONS Event Action Label Enter any 32 characters. This label is used in the Event Action Table. DTMF Sequence DTMF sequence uses ASCII characters '0' - '9', 'A' - 'D', '*', & '#'. Sequence is a maximum of 6 characters in length. Spaces between characters are not permitted. AIB-4 User Manual Page 17 of 28 EVENT ACTION TABLE On an Event Action Table line, select an EVENT IN on the left side of the table and then select an ACTION on the right side. Some events only support ON ACTIONS, so the OFF ACTION entries will be grayed out. One EVENT IN can trigger more than one ACTION. Select the same EVENT IN on multiple lines and then select an ON or OFF ACTION on each line. Only EVENTs and ACTIONs associated with the Remote Device’s Device Type or Connection Type will be displayed in the drop down menus. If the desired event or action is not displayed, then go to the Remote Device Assignment web page and change the Device Type or Connection Type for the Remote Device. There are 16 Sequence Timers. Use each Sequence Timer event number in multiple lines as the Event Type to create a sequence of actions. The first Sequence entry from the top of the table will be the first sequence action. The next Sequence entry from the top of the table will be the next sequence action. The Event column time is the delay before that line’s action will execute. Use Sequence Start action to start a sequence. Use Sequence Stop/ Reset to stop a sequence. The Sequence will always start at its first line.

Upon receipt of a Sequence Start action, the timer for the Sequence’s first entry in the Event Action Table will start. Upon receipt of a Sequence Stop action, the sequence will immediately stop. The sequence entry in progress will halt without executing. The next Start action will cause the sequence to start at its first entry in the Event Action Table. When the last Sequence action executes, the sequence will automatically turn off and stop executing. If the last Sequence action is Sequence Start, the sequence will loop until a Sequence Stop is received. Example #1 Wait for Sequence Start action and then play sequence until end and stop.

In order to enforce the rights under this warranty, the customer must first contact DNF’s Customer Support Department to afford the opportunity of identifying and fixing the problem without sending the unit in for repair. If DNF’s Customer Support Department cannot fix the problem, the customer will be issued a Returned Merchandise Authorization number (RMA). The customer will then ship the defective product prepaid to DNF Controls with the RMA number clearly indicated on the customer’s shipping document. The merchandise is to be shipped to: DNF Controls 19770 Bahama St. Northridge, CA 91324 USA Failure to obtain a proper RMA number prior to returning the product may result in the return not being accepted, or in a charge for the required repair. DNF Controls, at its option, will repair or replace the defective unit. DNF Controls will return the unit prepaid to the customer. The method of shipment is at the discretion of DNF Controls, principally UPS Ground for shipments within the United States of America. Shipments to international customers will be sent via air. Should a customer require the product to be returned in a more expeditious manner, the return shipment will be billed to their freight account. This warranty will be considered null and void if accident, misuse, abuse, improper line voltage, fire, water, lightning or other acts of God damaged the product. All repair parts are to be supplied by DNF Controls, either directly or through its authorized dealer network. Similarly, any repair work not performed by either DNF Controls or its authorized dealer may void the warranty.
