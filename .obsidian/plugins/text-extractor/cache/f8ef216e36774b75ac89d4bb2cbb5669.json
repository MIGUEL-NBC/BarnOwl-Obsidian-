Output Processor/Color Corrector Block OUT-35 board (MVS-8000X/7000X)/OUT-35A board (MKS-8160X) The OUT-35 and OUT-35A boards are output processing boards that have out process, format conversion, multisource display, and CCR (Color Corrector) functions. Each of these boards consists of the following blocks. . SDI input/output block . Format converter block) . Multisource display block (Support in the future) . CCR (Color Corrector) processing block The OUT-35 and OUT-35A boards are controlled by the CPU module on the XPT-31 board. [SDI input/output block]: IC1 to IC7 The SDI input/output block selects the SDI signals that are input from the XPT board in the cross point block, performs out processes such as video process, blanking, safe title, superimposition, and output phase adjustment, and then sends processed signals to the XPT board in the cross point block or the rear CNO-38 board. This block also sends video processed signals to the format converter block and the multisource display block. [Format converter block]: IC8, IC12 to IC17 The format converter block converts the video format of the 2-channel signals received from IC1, and sends the signals to the rear CNO-38 board. [Multisource display block]: IC9, IC18, IC19 The multisource display block selects signals for screens from the 24-channel signals received from IC1 to IC6, and converts the selected signals to multisource display output signals, and then sends them to the rear CNO-38 board through IC5. [CCR processing block]: IC10, IC20 to IC25 The CCR processing block performs CCR processing such as primary, secondary, and spot processing, and sends the processed signals to the XPT board in the cross point block through IC7. This block is not mounted on the OUT-35A board.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
