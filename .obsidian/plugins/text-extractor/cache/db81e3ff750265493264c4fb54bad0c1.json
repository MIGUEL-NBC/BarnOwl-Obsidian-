Most testing we have ever done with the Evertz Magnum Team combing all systems and remote/onsite teams checking all areas/control rooms. The ENG Routing Input issue reported last week has been resolved and should not have any further issues. Kevin Long signed off and he was very happy to see this get resolved. Summary of the work we did this evening: Applied a patch to PROD-EXE Core Magnum to resolve the outstanding GFX ENG Input Routing Issue. Release notes for route-service version 1.2.33 Patch • Fixed issue- When routing to cloud devices connected to a NAT, the first port of the switch is always used regardless of what port should be used • Fixed issue- Routing passthrough when main NAT is down does not tally Attached is a checklist outlining all the areas and systems tested between Operations and Engineering. Please reach out if any off issues pop up onsite. Trevor Bascomb NBCUniversal Manager, Production Systems Engineering","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
