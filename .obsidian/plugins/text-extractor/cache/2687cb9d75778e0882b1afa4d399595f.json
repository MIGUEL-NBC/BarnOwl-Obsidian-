INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION INSTALLATION Refer to the REAR PANEL CONNECTORS section for GPI, GPO, and serial connector pin out information. Refer to the GPIs, WET/ DRY Configuration and GPOs, WET/ DRY Configuration sections for GPI and GPO Wet/ Dry configuration information. Use the GPI Events web page to configure GPI operation. Use the GPO Actions web page to configure GPO operation. Use the Serial Port Configuration web page to configure the serial port. Use the Remote Device Assignment web page to configure Ethernet connections. Use the Event Action Table web page to map key presses to Remote Devices and the serial port. Use the Tally Assignment web page to configure key tallies. POWER The USP-24/48 is powered from an Ethernet switcher/ router that supports Power Over Ethernet (POE), or from the supplied external power supply. Power requirement is 12 volts DC at 2 amps from an external power supply and 13 Watts from POE switch. DEFAULT ETHERNET CONFIGURATION (Supports only 10BASE-T at Half-Duplex) IP Address: 192.168.10.217 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0 Gateway: 192.168.10.1 RESET Press the RESET switch on the rear of the unit to reboot it. Switch S1 Press and hold the S1 switch for 10 seconds to reset the IP address, subnet mask, Gateway, and configuration to factory defaults. CONFIGURATION The USP-S24/48 is configured using a standard web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome). Enter the USP’s IP address in the Address/ URL bar, typically located at the top of the web browser page, to access the configuration Home Page. Use the links on the left side of the Home Page to access the desired configuration web page. All configuration settings are saved in non-volatile memory in the unit. Settings are retained when power is removed. Settings may be uploaded to a computer as a configuration file (.dnf) for storage. Configuration files may be downloaded from a computer into the USP to restore a saved configuration. A configuration file contains all of configuration settings except IP address, subnet mask, and gateway address. Partial configuration upload or download is not supported. The configuration file is a not a text formatted file. It can not be viewed or modified with a text editor. To access the System Configuration web page, use the following log-on when prompted. User name: dnfuser Password: controls Page 4 of 27 SYSTEM CONFIGURATION Web Page P1 Software Upgrade: Use this link to install the P1 upgrade file provided by DNF Controls P2 Software Upgrade: Use this link to install the P2 upgrade file provided by DNF Controls Web Upgrade: Use this link to install the Web pages upgrade file provided by DNF Controls Save Configuration to PC: Use this link to save the current configuration to a configuration file on a computer. The web browser will prompt for file name and directory. The file extension must be ‘dnf’. Restore Configuration from PC: Use this link to download a configuration file from your computer. The web browser will prompt for directory and configuration file name. The file extension must be ‘dnf’. Set Factory Defaults: Use this link to reset all configurations to factory defaults. This will NOT change the IP address, subnet mask or gateway address. The unit will automatically reboot. Enter Label Enter device identifier that is displayed on the home page. Enter the new IP settings below: Enter the new IP address, Gateway, and Subnet Mask. Click on Save Config to save the new entries. The AIB will automatically reboot. Page 5 of 27 2. GPI EVENTS Configuration Web Page GPI Label Enter any 15 characters or symbols. For convenience only.

Some events only support ON ACTIONS, so the OFF ACTION entries will be grayed out. There are 64 lines in the Event Action Table. One EVENT IN can trigger more than one ACTION. Select the same EVENT IN on multiple lines and then select an ON or OFF ACTION on each line. Only EVENTs and ACTIONs associated with the Remote Device’s Device Type or Connection Type will be displayed in the drop down menus. If the desired event or action is not displayed, then go to the Remote Device Assignment web page and change the Device Type or Connection Type for the Remote Device. In the Event Action and Tally Assignment Tables, the USP-S24/48 keys are identified by their Column, Row position for easy identification. Key number #11 is located in column #1, on row #1. Key number #16 is located in column #1, on row #6. Key number #84 is located in column #8, on row #4. Page 15 of 27 Source None (Disable line) Local Event Local: GPI GPI changed from OFF to ON.

PANEL KEY MAPPER™ APPLICATION The DNF Controls supplied Panel Key Mapper™ is a small Windows® application that maps USP-S24 and USP-S48 key presses to HOTKEYs for Editors, Graphic devices, Production Playout & Automation systems, as well as other Windows based applications. For example, map USP-S24 Key: #2 to “SHIFT F3” #10 to “CTRL SHIFT F10” #23 to “CTRL ALT F1” The USP-S24/48 connects to the Windows computer running Panel Key Mapper (pkm.exe) over an Ethernet connection, eliminating USB connectivity issues in mission critical applications. The USP-S24/48 provides single button control for commonly used functions reducing errors, which saves time and money. Use the Key Mapper web page to create the HOTKEY key combinations used by the Editor or other Windows applicaton. Use the Event Action Table to map a key press to one or more Key Mapper entries and assign the Remote Device to transmit the HOTKEY to. One HOTKEY can be sent to multiple remote devices. INSTALLATION Install the supplied pkm.exe and pkm.ini files in a folder on the Windows computer. Edit the pkm.ini with Notepad.exe or other simple text editor. (Do not use a word processor.) Change the Panel 1 IP address to the IP address of the USP-S24 or USP- S48 that will send HOTKEYs to the computer. Change the Port number from 50000 to any other port number if that port is already in use on the computer. Add pkm.exe to the computer’s Start Up folder or create a Scheduled Task to launch the application when the computer starts up. Or, using a mouse, double click on the application to launch it. A black box will appear briefly on the screen and then disappear. Check Windows’ Task Manager to confirm that pkm.exe is running. LOGGING pkm.exe will create a log file, pkm.log, in the same folder that it resides. Open the log file with a text editor. Each time pkm.exe is launched the log file will show: 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 DNF Control Panel Key Mapper Log 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 pkm.exe startup 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 Console hidden 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 C:\\temp\\pkm.exe Version 1.3 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 Successfully opened file C:\\temp\\pkm.ini 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 Successfully processed file C:\\temp\\pkm.ini 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 Listening on Port 50000 for Panel Key Mapper commands 04/02/2011, 13:09:41 Accepting commands from Panel IP Address 192.168.10.62 where Panel IP Address and Port will reflect the pkm.ini entries.
