In order for the system to understand where it is, the camera needs to be moved around within the starting area, eventually all the stars will turn blue and the magnifying glass will go away. The system can be started up anywhere as long as it can see stars, the more stars it sees, the faster it will find its location. Once the stars turn blue, the system is ready for tracking and will begin sending data to tracking hub. Tracking Hub: Tracking hub currently is setup to use 3 tracking systems, but this may change in the near future and the doc will be updated accordingly with what each tracking system is for and what connections it needs etc. For now we will focus on the general setup of a system. When looking at tracking hub, the tracker will show up as red and you can see in status history that it is not receiving any data. Once RedSpy is turned on and has found it’s location, tracking hub should automatically begin to receive data, ts# will turn green and it will show a status history of receiving data. Basic Troubleshooting: If the tracking hub is not showing a connection, there a few things to check. Make sure you are getting a connection light on the PC, if not check that the network cable is plugged in on both sides and isn’t damaged. Next you can check to make sure the RedSpy is pointing to the proper tracking hub IP as well as the correct port. Press the button with the square and globe to bring you to the network page. Each unit has been assigned an IP address and for the time being, they are all pointing to the same tracking hub, 100.113.83.224. Each RedSpy points to a different port on the trackinghub. The example is pointing to 6301. On tracking hub, when you click on a ts, it will show you which port that ts is listening for. On tracking hub, if the system is connected, the port will be greyed out, however if it is disconnected, you can change the port to the appropriate number. RedSpy can’t find itself? First make sure the red lens cap has been removed. If the system is turned on and is continually searching the map for stars and keeps showing the magnifying glass, the wrong map may be loaded. (This will most likely only be an issue with the Steadicam as that is the only one that changes maps, more accurate photos of this will be added to the documentation) If you need to reload a map profile, click the two arrow buttons on top, then press load profile. Select the proper profile: Then hit the check mark and the new map should load. Proceed to move the camera around again and try to get the unit to see the map.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
