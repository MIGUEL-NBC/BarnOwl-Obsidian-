MVE Interface Block The MVE interface block is an option (MKS-8170X) of the MVS-8000X and an option (MKS-7171X) of the MVS-7000X. MKS-8170X consists of an XPT-32 board, a CNI-37 board, and a CNO-37 board. MKS-7171X consists of a CNO-37 board. (1) XPT-32 board (MKS-8170X) The XPT-32 board confi gures a 80 x 80 serial matrix. The DME1 V/K and DME2 V/K signals sent from each MIX-53 board are assigned to DME OUT signals by the serial matrix and are output. The DME IN signals are assigned to each MIX-53 board as EFF IN1 V/K and EFF IN2 V/K signals and are output. The DME IN signals are also assigned to the DME Monitor signal and are output to the XPT-31 board. The DME Utility 1 and DME Utility 2 signals sent from the XPT-31 or XPT-31A board are processed by the FPGA, and are then sent to the serial matrix. The MVE interface block is controlled by the CPU module board on the XPT-31 board. (2) CNI-37 board (MKS-8170X) The CNI-37 board is a 20-channel input connector board on the rear panel of the unit. The CNI-37 board corrects the characteristics of 20-channel input signals by the cable equalizer circuit and the reclocker circuit, and outputs the corrected signals through the motherboard to the XPT-32 board. (3) CNO-37 board (MKS-8170X, MKS-7171X) The CNO-37 board is a 20-channel output connector board on the rear panel of the unit. This board outputs the 20-channel signals that are input from the XPT-32 board through the motherboard by the reclocker circuit and the cable driver circuit as DME OUT signals.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
