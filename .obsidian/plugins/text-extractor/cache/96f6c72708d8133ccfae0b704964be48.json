A new VUE page has been added so that TDs can swing which CR’s program is going to Morpheus for air. Only one CR can go to Morpheus at a time. When we’re doing NNN across 74, 2E, and also 76/V1, it will be our job to run these salvos at the right time to swing the transmit paths. Before explaining how this works, I want to nail three points home right off the bat: This is a precarious juggle and must be done with extreme caution. Switches should only at the clear direction of the Director or TPM with authorization from Editorial. Do not freelance this! These switches should happen in a break whenever possible, but can be done while live on air if needed.
