Since News Staff do not report onsite anymore, we are taking advantage and we are making room in the racks to install new Evertz gear. This will be used to cutover the whole 4E Production and News areas to the EXEs. News/Assignment Desk Area 1. SAHUB4X1 (SATOPS26) 2. SAHUB4X2 (SATOPS27) 3. SAHUB4X3 (SATOPS28 4.

TOC4FL03 PLEASE NOTE For the very rare case that you get a call that those panels in 4E need to be used (Donâ€™t intend to), then someone just needs to head into the 4E-IDF and push to reinsert the cards in the Encore frame. After a couple minutes, everything will come back online. Over the next couple of weeks, we are planning to remove the whole Encore frame and switches. You can see from this picture below.
