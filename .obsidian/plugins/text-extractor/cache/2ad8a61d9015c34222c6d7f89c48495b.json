This box is meant to be a backup video scaler to feed the 6A Studio Leyard LED Wall. To connect to the Corio, first you must download the CorioGrapher software: https://www.dropbox.com/s/18uilqourwh8lfj/Setup%20CORIOgrapherV2%20%282.2.2.2%29.exe?dl=0 It may ask you to install a Microsoft plugin, which you should go ahead and do. Once the software is installed, launch it and select Connect to Device. Enter IP 100.103.64.49 and administrator login admin and password adminpw. You will have the several options; if you are wishing to only view the current config and make no changes, select Connect. If you need to change the current config, select Read. Do not select Send unless you have made an offline config that you are now uploading. Once you read the current config, you have essentially downloaded the current online configuration from the Corio frame to your local PC. Now you can edit the layouts and settings for the Corio. The Displays that are laid out in the main wall editor should NEVER BE CHANGED. These represent the way the signal distribution is set for the 6A Studio wall, so changing the displays would make it impossible to properly lay out video on the walls. Rather, what might need to be changed are Windows, which represent video sources into the Corio. Each of these is named after the 3NMR destination that then turns into a Corio source (i.e. DDR-3N44). These are all 1080p inputs (all sources into corio pass thru a For A cross converter which ensures that no matter what resolution is coming in, it’s always 1080p coming out). The source Windows can be laid out and scaled in any way that’s needed. There are two editing modes: Immediate and Synchronized. In Immediate mode, everything you do gets taken as soon as you move the mouse. This allows the operator to see the results of changes right away. In Synchronized mode, you are essentially building a layout offline until you hit TAKE, at which point the change is made. Importantly, none of the changes you makes will save permanently until you hit Save On Device…this will replace the current online config with the changes you’ve made. Only one config can be active on the box at any given time. Save to File allows you to save a local file backup of the config in case it needs to be recalled. To recall a saved file, go to the Home tab and then select Load Configuration. There are Presets built which represent different layouts that can be loaded to the LED walls. Whenever a preset is loaded, it immediately takes over the visible output. You cannot load a preset without taking it…this is important, because a preset should not be loaded while you’re live on the air with the LED wall visible unless you intend to change the layout live. When making a new preset, hit the Presets button and give a name for the preset. When editing a preset, it is critical that you hit Save Preset. Lastly, you must Save on Device or else the presets will disappear the next time a config gets loaded. In the bottom left area of the Wall Editor, there are four small circles. Each one represents a Canvas. We are using one Canvas for each LED wall. The first canvas is for the South Anchor Wall. The second Canvas is for the Vista Wall. The third Canvas is for the Ingest/Portrait Wall. Presets affect only a particular canvas, which is labeled as part of the name of the preset. tvOne tech support is available Monday thru Friday from 9 am til 6 pm at 888-520-7479 or tech.usa@tvone.com.
