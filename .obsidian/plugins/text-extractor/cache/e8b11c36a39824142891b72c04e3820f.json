CN-2585 Board / IF-962 BoardMKE-8021A consists of the CN-2585 board and the IF-962 board.The CN-2585 and IF-962 boards have HD/SD SDI interface with MVE-8000A and a monitor-out function. These boards receive control and configuration from the VIF-32 board. The video signals are transmitted/received to/from the VIF-32 board using the LVDS technology.Input processingV1 to V4, K1 to K4: The video signals input through the HD/SD SDI interface are converted to LVDS signals in the FPGAs (IC1, IC2), and are then sent to the VIF-32 board.Output processingV1 to 4, K1 to 4: The LVDS video signals sent from the VIF-32 board are serialized by the FPGAs (IC1, IC2), and are then output as HD/SD SDI signals.MONI1 to 4: The LVDS video signals sent from the VIF-32 board are transferred to the channel link deserializers (IC1101, IC1102), are serialized by the FPGAs (IC1, IC2), and are then output as HD/SD SDI signals.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
