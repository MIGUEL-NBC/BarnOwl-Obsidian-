{"path":"PDF Library/30 Rock Global Infrastructure/PPI/PPI_PC_Config.docx","text":"Interactive PC Checklist Department Involved: Production Application Engineering Author: Date: Enzo Sangiorgio 3/14/2022 Objective/Purpose: Default configuration for PCs displaying Digital Interactive app for on-air touchscreen hits. Escalations: For connectivity and performance issues isolated to the web shortcuts themselves, reach out to the News Digital team with the problem statement, URL affected, and any information gathered. Note: If a link is not loading on a touchscreen, make sure you can access that URL from your own PC that has working NBCU network access, and if only one or all shortcuts are not loading. NBC News Digital Ops Support (NBCUniversal) nos@nbcuni.com Braun, Josh (NBCUniversal) <Josh.Braun@nbcuni.com> 1: Network \tThe machine should be on NBCU corp and needs to be able to access the News Digital team’s web server: https://develop-hitrouter.dev.nbcnewstools.net 2: BIOS Wake On Power \tThis step differs based on the motherboard the PC is using, refer to the manual for how to access the BIOS. You must set the power option for Wake on Power to ON. It may be called something different depending on the manufacturer, but we want to make sure the PC powers on automatically when plugged in by stage crew. 3: Windows Auto-Logon \tMake sure the default user you want is a local administrator and uses a known default password, then follow these steps: Click on Start, then type netplwiz and press Enter. UNCHECK “Users must enter a user name and password on this computer” Click OK, then enter the default user credentials when prompted. Reboot to confirm. 4: Disable Windows Notifications and Automatic Updates Disabling Windows Notifications: https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/disable-notifications-windows-10 \tNote: Before disabling Windows Updates, check to make sure the most current updates are installed. \tDisable Automatic Updates: Click on Start and type services.msc and press Enter. Look for Windows Update. Right click and Stop the service (if already stopped, continue.) Double-click the Windows Update service, and in the Startup Type dropdown, select Manual, and click OK. 5: Install and Configure Browser \tInstall the latest version of Chrome from the internet and disable all notifications and auto-updates. Set as default browser in Windows. 6: Digital Interactive Shortcuts \tThe NBC News Digital team hosts the Interactive app themselves. The shortcuts are direct links to the various board, identified by color. Example Shortcut: \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\" https://develop-hitrouter.dev.nbcnewstools.net/?output=color --start-fullscreen --kiosk -incognito --disable-pinch --overscroll-history-navigation=0 --check-for-update-interval=604800 The shortcuts also contain several necessary Chrome flags. These are already saved, but if you need to test or create a new shortcut they are explained here: --start-fullscreen (self-explanatory) --kiosk (does not let the user exit the Chrome session) --incognito (prevents caching to avoid loading old data) --disable-pinch (disables pinch-to-zoom gesture) --overscroll-history-navigation=0 (disables swipe to go back gesture) --check-for-updates-interval=604800 (sets the interval to check for updates to the maximum time. Updates and notifications should already be disabled in Chrome, this is here as a failsafe)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
