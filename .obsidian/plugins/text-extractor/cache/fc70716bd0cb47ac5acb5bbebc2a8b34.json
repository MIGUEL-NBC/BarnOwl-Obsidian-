DENZSTREAMER RESTARTS Hi folks, as you’re aware we have lots of at-home (and in building!) operators and producers using NBC News Monitors site to monitor control room and studio feeds. All of the sources for these feeds are located on our WFH sharepoint doc: https://nbcuni-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/206082017_tfayd_com/ER-1cFKjEkNIifDdTNNuISUBPGs4k8kM3of1A0wURXd7UQ On the doc, on the WebRTC Multiviews tab you’ll find a LOT of lines of info. Each one pertains to a specific stream, the description for which is located all the way on the right. If someone calls about an issue with a stream, step 1 is to look at it yourself and make sure the issue is not with the user’s Internet or VPN access. Remind them to connect to Test-EC or Test-EC2 on Global Protect to ensure they get the best speed for video streaming. If the stream does indeed appear to be significantly delayed (ie more than 2 seconds) or not working, you may need to reboot the Denz streamer channel for that particular stream. Denz is a set of physical and VM encoders that converts incoming video to WebRTC for feeding into the NBC News Monitors site. If you need to reboot a channel, click on the Denz Server link for that particular stream (ie https://denzstreamer01.inbcu.com/) The credentials to log in as an admin are on the same line in the WFH sharepoint doc. Once logged in, go to Broadcast Encoder and then on the left select the encoder channel that you need to restart. Each Denz has either 8 or 16 encoder channels…just count down from the top of the list on the WFH doc for that particular Denz to figure out which channel it is. Click on the encoder channel and then on the top right of the screen select Restart. This will take the channel down for 5-10 seconds and instantly pop it back up for the user.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
