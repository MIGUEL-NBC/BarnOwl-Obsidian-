All (210) ITXEs are on the latest and greatest code. We had two card failures (REM 159 and 160), but James helped us swap those two and MTC signed off on them. We have one additional ITXE Card spare on 4S and I have two more coming from Evertz RMAs. Last step tomorrow evening is to update the ITXE API Driver on the ACQ Core Magnums, which will activate the REM “UNITY” feature across the MTC VUE Panels and REM Control VUE Panel at Video Stations. Please be aware again of any reports and let us know if anything pops up. Trevor Bascomb NBCUniversal Manager, Production Systems Engineering","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
