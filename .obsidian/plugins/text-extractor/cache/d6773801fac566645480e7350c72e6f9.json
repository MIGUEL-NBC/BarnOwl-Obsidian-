This box is meant to be a backup video scaler to feed the 3A Studio Leyard LED Wall. To connect to the Corio, first you must download the CorioGrapher software: http://tvone.crmdesk.com/image.aspx?mode=file&id=14131 It may ask you to install a Microsoft plugin, which you should go ahead and do. Once the software is installed, launch it and select Connect to Device. Enter IP 100.103.100.14 and administrator login admin and password adminpw. You will have the several options; if you are wishing to only view the current config and make no changes, select Connect. If you need to change the current config, select Read. Do not select Send unless you have made an offline config that you are now uploading. Once you read the current config, you have essentially downloaded the current online configuration from the Corio frame to your local PC. Now you can edit the layouts and settings for the Corio. The Displays that are laid out in the main window should NEVER BE CHANGED. These represent the way the signal distribution is set for the 3A Studio wall, so changing the displays would make it impossible to properly lay out video on the walls. Rather, what the operators will be changing are Windows, which represent video sources into the Corio. Each of these is named after the 3NMR destination that then turns into a Corio source (i.e. DDR-3N41). These are all 1080p inputs (all sources into corio pass thru a For A cross converter which ensures that no matter what resolution is coming in, it’s always 1080p coming out. The sources Windows can be laid out and scaled in any way the operator chooses. There are two editing modes: Immediate and Synchronized. In Immediate mode, everything you do gets taken as soon as you move the mouse. This allows the operator to see the results of changes right away. In Synchronized mode, you are essentially building a layout offline until you hit TAKE, at which point the change is made. Importantly, none of the changes you makes will save permanently until you hit Save On Device…this will replace the current online config with the changes you’ve made. Only one config can be active on the box at any given time. Save to File allows you to save a local file backup of the config in case it needs to be recalled. To recall a saved file, go to the Home tab and then select Load Configuration. The operators have built a number of Presets which represent different layouts that can be loaded to the LED wall. Whenever they load one of these presets, it immediately takes over the visible output of the Corio. You cannot load a preset without taking it…this is important, because a preset should not be loaded while you’re live on the air with the LED wall visible unless you intend to change the layout live. When making a new preset, hit the Presets button and give a name for the preset. When editing a preset, it is critical that you hit Save Preset. Lastly, you must Save on Device or else the presets will disappear the next time a config gets loaded. There are many advanced features in the Corio which we may ultimately take advantage of, but for the initial launch of the LED wall, it is serving a backup roll with very specific items routed into it and scaled in such a way that one image fills the East Wall and another filles the South Wall. It’s important that the positioning or scaling of these images is not changed, or else they will not line up correctly in the corner where the two walls meet. tvOne tech support is available Monday thru Friday from 9 am til 6 pm at 888-520-7479 or tech.usa@tvone.com.
