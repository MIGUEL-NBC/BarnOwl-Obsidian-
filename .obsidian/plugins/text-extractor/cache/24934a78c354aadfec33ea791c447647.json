This write-up follows after Node Registration. First we will Create a Leaf Interface Profile for the switch that we configured in the Node Registration segment. We will use the same example node (lf55) as we did in the last manual. Log into an APIC controller using your SSO. (100.113.18.11-15) 1. Go to Fabric, and click on access policies in the blue tab area. 2. Hit the drop down arrow for interface, then leaf interfaces, then profiles. This will open a long list of items labeled LIP_XXXX. 3. Right click on the folder labeled profiles. Click – Create Leaf Interface Profile. 4. In the name section of the window that pops up, enter LIP_RCK. You assigned the rack number when you registered the node. You can access that information by referring back to the previous guide. In our case with Leaf 55, our Rack is 060A, so our Name is LIP_060A. Then click the + sign next to interface selectors. 5. You can add interface selectors here as well as in another page. Let’s add one here. The access port selectors refer to each of the 48 ports in the switch. The naming nomenclature is e1_1. The ID for that would 1/1. For port 2, it would e1_2, ID 1/2. Port 3 e1_3, ID 1/3, etc until e1_48, ID 1/48. a. The Interface Policy Group will always be 1G_INT_POLGRP. b. This can be also be found by double clicking on the Leaf interface after you submit the profile name. Just click the + sign next to the interface selectors tab of the page once you open the LIP name you just assigned. c. Adding the 48 ports can be automated with a custom script using API Post commands. Next we will assign Leaf Switch Profiles. 1. Go to Fabric, and click on access policies in the blue tab area. 2. Hit the drop down arrow for Switches, leaf switches, and then click on profiles. You will see a page open on the right side showing a name with the standard SW_XXXX linked to an interface selector. 3. Right click on Profiles, and click create leaf profile. 4. In the name area, type SW_XXXX, once again use your RACK number and not your leaf number. In our example, that is SW_060A. 5. Then click on the plus sign next to Leaf Selectors. This will drop another section down. a. In the name area use the same name as you did in step 4, SW_060A. b. In the blocks section, use your NODE ID. Since we are working with leaf 55, our Node ID is 255. c. Leave Policy group blank. Click next. 6. Step 2 will be for associations. In the section labeled Interface Selector Profiles, scroll down and find the LIP_XXXX you created in the last section. It should match with the SW_XXXX you are working on now. In our case, LIP_060A. Then click submit. We have now associated LIP_060A to SW_060A. You may need to refresh the page to see the association on the page. Now we’ll talk about assigning VLANs. This section is a work in progress. Each port on a leaf can be assigned to a VLAN on an EPG. Figuring out which VLAN is supposed to be assigned to which port on which leaf can be tricky. You will need to use the wire database, wiredb.inbcu.com in order to figure out what goes where. For now, lets talk about the racks. Racks 55- 78 house all of the switches for our system. Racks 55-57 are for Control 31, and Racks 76-78 are for Control 32. More information on what racks are for what rooms will be added later. Racks are tied together in groups of 3. Every 4th rack will repeat its VLAN properties from rack 1. That is, rack 55 will have identical VLAN configuration as Rack 58. Rack 56 = 59. 57= 60. This means that once we have the configurations for racks 55-57 complete, we can assign all the VLANS for all of the racks in the system. Each leaf has 48 ports as we’ve discussed before. Each of these ports will be linked to a specific VLAN. The easiest way to do this to go to the ACI GUI page at https://100.113.37.20:8456/acigui Here, you can select your switch (lf55) and then a port number (1-48). Last you will assign it a VLAN in the drop down labeled EPG. If you just query a switch, you will see that port and VLAN associations already exist on that switch. The easy way to set up your VLANS would be to query the switch with identical VLAN configuration, and copy the configs one by one for each assigned port. Now lets go back to the APIC, and take a look at some information we can find there. Navigate to the Tenants page 1. Double Click on TN_7N 2. Hit the drop down arrow on Application Profiles, the AP_PROD, and click on Application EPGs. a. This shows you a list of the EPGS (how we use VLANS). Note that there are several pages and by default you will see only 15 EPGS per page. i. By double clicking an EPG you can view what clients are connected, their IPs, and Node IDs under the operational Client End-Points page. ii. Once you click into an EPG, you will see a drop down arrow next to the EPG name on the left side. Click this drop down to see additional settings. iii. In Domains, if there are no Domains set you will not be able to add a VLAN. You can add a domain by right clicking domains. You will be able to add X or Y domains depending on which domain you need to be able to access. 1. Deploy static EPG on PC,VPC, or Interface (right click on Static Ports) a. Node: hostname b. Path: eth1/1…1/48 c. VLAN: #in name d. This will be explained more in depth later. 3. Look back to the left side menu pane, and hit the drop down arrow for Networking. Then Click on Bridge Domains. a. The Bridge domains are names 1-1 with the EPGs, so if you are investigating EPG 104, you can double click BD_104 here. You can see the multicast address here before you double click. i. Under policy, you will see that the VRF is selected to VRF_PROD. If this is an internal switch and this is set to something else, it will not be able to communicate with other devices in the same network. ii. It is through here where you can adjust subnets (via L3 configurations) if you needed to. Note that if you change a subnet or add a gateway you will need to update the contract. We will go over this in more detail in the next session. Lastly, if you want to check the status of an interface; 1. Go to Fabric, Inventory, Pod 1, hostname you want to investigate arrow, Interfaces, Physical Interfaces. 2. If you added a wrong port or messed something up or just want to check a physical ports status, you will see it here. 3. Admin State indicates if you have enabled it or not. This should be green by default. a. If Switching state in disabled and Oper state is disabled it may indicate nothing is connected to the port.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
